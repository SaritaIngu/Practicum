      "WhatsApp starts plan to charge business customersAug. 1, 2018 12:36 PM ET|By: Jason Aycock, SA News EditorWith usage and revenue growth starting to moderate at WhatsApp, parent Facebook (FB -0.4%) is flipping a revenue switch with its plan to charge businesses for sending messages to consumers.That comes via the WhatsApp Business API, which allows for a variety of customized notifications. WhatsApp launched a business app for Android phones in January, with plans to eventually charge businesses.Confirmed delivery of marketing and support messages will range from 0.5 cents to 9 cents per message, with rates varying by country. Businesses can also respond to questions or comments free within 24 hours of receipt.That's more expensive than typical SMS carriage rates, but WhatsApp points to data showing business clients seeing heavy read rates on delivered messages.\n"

Issues including \"Unite the Right\" and \"#AbolishICE\" are the focus of the fake accounts' activities.Previous work by the Russia-linked Internet Research Agency focused on inflaming divisive American issues ahead of the 2016 election.Updated 12:47 p.m.: Facebook has posted. \"Today we removed 32 Pages and accounts from Facebook and Instagram because they were involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior,\" the company says. While it doesn't know who's behind the effort, \"we are sharing what we know today given the connection between these bad actors and protests that are planned in Washington next week ... It’s clear that whoever set up these accounts went to much greater lengths to obscure their true identities than the Russian-based Internet Research Agency has in the past.\"\n"

      "Facebook not yet a bargain - Heard on the StreetJul. 27, 2018 8:20 AM ET|About: Facebook (FB)|By: Stephen Alpher, SA News EditorYesterday's plunge brought Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) valuation to 23x forward earnings - about it's lowest multiple ever, writes Dan Gallagher. Exclude net cash, and that drops to 21x, or a 16% discount to what investors are paying for Google.Wall Street's sell-side remains bullish, with more than 85% having a Buy rating on the stock (even after a couple of downgrades yesterday).Maybe not yet priced in though, says Gallagher, is the level of regulatory scrutiny underway, and what the privacy controversies have done to the company's image. Facebook saw its first notable decline in users in the U.S. and Europe last quarter - is it a blip or the start of a sustained downturn?Shares are up 1.15% premarket after yesterday's 19% decline.\n"

LLCShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLCBrian White - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLCLaura Martin - Needham & Co. LLCOperatorGood day and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I'd like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that we'll open the call to questions from analysts.Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, share repurchases, dividends and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently-filed periodic reports on form 10-K and form 10-Q and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective date.I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.Thank you, Nancy, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Today we're proud to report our best June quarter revenue and earnings ever thanks to the strong performance of iPhone, services and wearables. We generated $53.3 billion in revenue, a new Q3 record. That's an increase of 17% over last year's result, making it our seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and our strongest rate of growth in the past 11 quarters.Our team generated record Q3 earnings per share of $2.34, an increase of 40% over last year. We're extremely proud of these results and I'd like to share some highlights with you.First, iPhone had a very strong quarter. Revenue was up 20% year-over-year and our active installed base grew by double-digits, driven by switchers, first time smartphone buyers and our existing customers whose loyalty we greatly appreciate. iPhone X was the most popular iPhone in the quarter once again, with a customer satisfaction score of 98% according to 451 Research. Based on the latest data from IDC, iPhone grew faster than the global smartphone market, gaining share in many markets including the U.S., Greater China, Canada, Germany, Australia, Russia, Mexico and the Middle East and Africa.Second, we had a stellar quarter in services which generated all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion fueled in part by double-digit growth in our overall active installed base. We feel great about the momentum of our services business and we're on target to reach our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. Our record services results were driven by strong performance in a number of areas and I'd like to briefly mention just some of these.Paid subscriptions from Apple and third parties have now surpassed $300 million, an increase of more than 60% in the past year alone. Revenue from subscriptions accounts for a significant and increasing percentage of our overall services business. What's more, the number of apps offering subscriptions also continue to grow. There are almost 30,000 available in the App Store today.\n"
