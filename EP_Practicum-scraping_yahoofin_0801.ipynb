       " \"Electric-car company Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) second-quarter results are out. As expected, revenue soared and losses continued to mount. Beyond the quarter's financial results, Tesla's second-quarter update provided an important glimpse into other important areas, including Model 3 production, a forecast for cash to increase in the second half of the year, and more.Here's an overview of the results.Model 3. Image source: Tesla.MetricQ2 2018Q2 2017ChangeVehicle deliveries40,76822,02685%Revenue$4.0 billion$2.8 billion43%Non-GAAP EPS($3.06)($1.33)N/AGAAP EPS($4.22)($2.04)N/AData source: Tesla's second-quarter shareholder letter.Driven primarily by an 85% year-over-year increase in deliveries, Tesla's revenue increased 43% year over year to a record $4 billion. During the quarter, Tesla delivered 40,768 vehicles. Combined Model S and X deliveries amounted to 22,319 units, and Model 3 deliveries were 18,449.Highlighting how sharp Tesla's ramp-up in Model 3 production and deliveries is, the important vehicle's deliveries increased 125% sequentially.Tesla's non-GAAP loss per share of $3.06 was wider than its loss of $1.33 in the year-ago quarter, but it was narrower than its non-GAAP loss per share of $3.35 in Q1. Tesla's GAAP loss per share widened from a loss of $2.04 in the year-ago quarter to a loss of $4.22 in Q2, but this loss was nearly in line with its $4.19 loss per share in Q1.Tesla highlighted a range of important updates on its business in its second-quarter shareholder letter, including the following:Management believes the second half of the year will be far better than the first, driven by soaring Model 3 production and profitability.Expecting to achieve a Model 3 production rate of 6,000 units per week by the end of August, management anticipates seeing Model 3 production rise from 28,578 units\\xa0in Q2 to 50,000 to 55,000 units in Q3. Model 3 deliveries are expected to be even higher during the period.As Model 3 production and deliveries increase, Tesla expects to achieve improved economies of scale. Management said it expects a Model 3 gross margin of 15% in Q3 and about 20% in Q4. As a result, Tesla still expects to achieve GAAP profitability in Q3 and Q4 and believes its $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents will increase in both quarters.Longer-term, Tesla says it's aiming to achieve a Model 3 production rate of 10,000 units per week sometime next year.More From The Motley FoolDaniel Sparks owns shares of Tesla.

       " 'It’s back-to-school season, and parents across this great nation couldn’t be happier. Kids and college students, though, not so much.It’s also the best time to get back to saving on some of the hottest tech kids need to make the school year as productive as possible. Or, you could always just use the sales to score some great deals on gaming laptops.These are the best deals from Apple, Amazon and Best Buy.Apple (AAPL) hardly ever has sales, which makes the tech giant’s back-to-school deals a rarity. It’s like seeing a leprechaun riding a unicorn. To take advantage of Apple’s offers, though, you have to be either a student or teacher — and they’ll want proof.But if you’ve got it, you’ll score some big savings. Right off the bat, the company is offering a pair of Beats PowerBeats 3 wireless earphones, normally priced at $199, for free when you purchase an iPad Pro. You can also score a pair of Beats Solo3 over-the-ear headphones for $100, down from $299, or a pair of BeatsX earphones, normally $149, for free.Apple is also serving up some deals on its Mac products, offering up to $200 off qualifying Macs, up to 20% off Apple Care, or a pair of Beats Solo3s for free. Those are some serious savings.Fresh off of Prime Day, Amazon (AMZN) is bringing some love to students and parents in the form of major savings on laptops, tablets, and smartphones. For the student gamers out there, HP’s Omen X 17-inch laptop is marked down from $1,999 to $1,799.For students who are more interested in getting work done, otherwise known as nerds, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Surface Pro is 31% off, down from $1,159 to $799. ASUS’s beautiful ZenBook Ultra Slim is also marked down from $899 to $799.Want an Android tablet for your studies? Samsung’s got you covered with its Galaxy Tab S3 marked down from $549 to $399. Then there are the smartphones. The Android-powered Essential Phone, which normally goes for $499, is down to $423, while Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 has been reduced from $949 to $789.The big blue retailer is offering student discounts via BestBuy.com (BBY), but you’ll need to sign up for a student deals account to get in on the action. From there you can some solid deals including $50 off the latest model iPad Pro, $150 off select MacBooks including MacBook Pros and the MacBook Air, $100 to $150 off certain laptops and $100 off Microsoft Surface devices.That’s not all, though. The technology retailer is also offering $30 off Chromebooks, which is a lot when you consider they already sell for only about $300. And, of course, no deals list would be complete without savings on hardcore gaming rigs. In this case, Best Buy is offering $100 off select gaming laptops and desktops. See, you can have fun back-to-school shopping.Those are just a fraction of some of the great deals available this back-to-school season. But you’ll need to hurry if you want to take advantage of them, because they’ll only last a few more weeks.More from Dan:Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@oath.com; follow him on Twitter at\\xa0@DanielHowley.\\xa0Follow Yahoo Finance on\\xa0Facebook,\\xa0Twitter,\\xa0Instagram, and\\xa0LinkedIn',\n",

       " \"All except Facebook reported strong results with Facebook also disappointing on guidance. Here are a few details-Apple AAPLApple posted strong results for the June quarter with revenue and earnings topping the Zacks Consensus Estimates by 1.7% and 7.8%, respectively.Revenue growth was strong across geographies, with North America being the strongest, followed by Greater China, Other Asia and Europe, all of which grew double-digits. Services grew a whopping 31% and iPhones 20%, indicating that Apple’s strategy of launching expensive phones and capitalizing on its installed base is bang on.This is particularly significant because iPhones are 56% of its total sales, while services are an extremely fast-growing 18%. So effectively, the company has a solid, proven strategy for 74% of its business. The Other category that includes things like its Watch and HomePod that Apple doesn’t tell us much about, are also growing very strongly, further locking people into its ecosystem.There’s some difference of opinion among Apple watchers, with some liking its solid cash flows, services prospects and the amount it returns to shareholders and others arguing that its growth rates are coming down, indicating that other names are more attractive.But considering its valuation on P/E and PEG metrics in addition to the above positives, Apple is a steal.Amazon AMZNAmazon posted strong results for the June quarter with earnings topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 103.6% based on revenue that just missed a very high Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%. Currency contributed 2 points of the revenue growth of 39% and 6 points of the 375% growth in operating income. Earnings grew 1,167.5% from last year. TTM operating cash grew 22%. TTM free cash flow less lease principal repayments dropped 24%.So obviously, revenue growth was just one factor driving the results. One of the other factors was revenue mix, which favored high-margin AWS and advertising (included in other). The FX neutral revenue growth rates of 49% and 129% in these businesses were far above the company average. \\xa0Moreover, they are now contributing a combined 16% revenue share, so they’re having a greater impact on results. Subscription service ex-FX growth of 55% was another one to call out.Cost management and operating leverage also contributed to the earnings growth. These factors usually vary between quarters depending on the amount of new infrastructure being built out. But it’s encouraging to note that the very strong revenue growth has led to a stabilization and even decline in the capex as a percentage of revenue.The real fuel for Amazon’s business is data, just as it is with the big technology companies. Amazon has the largest amount of relevant data as regards people’s shopping behavior and payment information.The avenues for data collection are being expanded constantly with the proliferation of Echo and Alexa (number of Alexa-enabled devices more than tripled in the past year). This helps it develop artificial intelligence and lays the foundation for a strong advertising business. Amazon is currently working on measurement tools that will help advertisers gauge ROI.The one factor of slight caution is the debt level. The company raised a lot of debt last year but the debt cap ratio has been declining since then to more manageable levels. Rising profitability and cash levels means this isn’t necessarily a negative, just something to keep an eye on.The shares look overvalued, so watch out.Alphabet GOOGLAlphabet posted solid results for the June quarter with revenue (ex-TAC) and earnings topping the Zacks Consensus Estimates by 2.3% and 24.3%, respectively. Currency contributed 3 points of the gross revenue growth of 26%.Google numbers were as good as ever. Google advertising revenue grew 26% (revenue share 71%, drivers were mobile and desktop search, YouTube); Network advertising grew 14% (revenue share 15%, drivers were AdMob and programmatic); and Other grew 37% (revenue share 14%, drivers were cloud, Play and hardware). \\xa0Other Bets, mainly Fiber and Verily, grew 49% (less than half a point revenue share).The margin strategy remains same: focus on volume for Google properties with a willingness to sacrifice price and focus on price in the networking business, where Google gets only around a 30% share based on the traffic it sends partners. And revenue shared with network members dropped last quarter as a percentage of network sales due to mix benefits, partially offsetting the increase in TAC to distribution partners, most likely because of a deal adjustment with Apple.The big takeaway is that despite regulatory pressure (a $5 billion EU fine was provided for in the last quarter), rising SBC, a higher tax rate and increasing competition, this is a company that continues to generate strong operating results and cash flows. Its investments in people, capex and compute power are fueling its leadership in artificial intelligence, which continues to super-charge every aspect of its business.Moreover, despite its size and the volume of its business, it remains a growth company. Its PEG-based valuation indicates that there’s more room to run.Microsoft MSFTMicrosoft’s fourth quarter revenue and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates by 3.0% and 5.6%, respectively. Currency increased revenue and earnings growth by 2 points and 4 points, respectively to 17% and 7%, respectively.First-quarter revenue guidance of $27.70 billion at the midpoint was also slightly ahead of the FactSet estimate of $27.35 billion. More Personal Computing revenue of $10.10 billion (versus $9.87 billion estimated), Intelligent Cloud $8.25 billion (in-line) and Productivity and Business Processes $9.35 billion (versus $9.34 billion estimated) contributed to the upside.Management has done a very good job turning the company around from a provider of legacy solutions to a leading provider of enterprise solutions whether on premise, or in the cloud or in facilitating a transition to the cloud through partnerships, collaborations and acquisitions.And that is why its Azure cloud business delivered FX adjusted 85% growth in the last quarter off a growing base. It’s also why Office 365 commercial, Dynamics 365, Gaming, and Xbox software and services grew a respective 35%, 56%, 38% and 35%. Other important product lines like servers and Surface also grew strong double digits.Microsoft is a company generating solid cash flows from a legacy business that is supplemented with momentum in several other high-growth markets. It is another company investing heavily in artificial intelligence that it is both infusing in its own operations and offering to customers.The shares are however overvalued, so best avoided unless it’s for the long term.Facebook FBFacebook’s June quarter sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.45% while its earnings missed by less than a percent. This is the first time it missed estimates in the last seven quarters and the first time on both the top and bottom lines.Mobile ad revenue (91% of the business) grew 50%, both DAUs and MAUs were up 11%, the average price per ad increased 17% and the number of ad impressions increased 21%. Payments and other fees, making up the remaining 9%, was up 23%. None of this was too bad.But significantly, expenses also increased 50% with full-time employees up 47% as it tried to deliver on its security and privacy promises.Moreover guidance was for continued deceleration in the revenue growth rate through the rest of the year accompanied by a 50-60% increase in expenses versus last year. Not all of these expenses will be recovered soon either: management said that while AI related epenses will improve results in the near term, AR and VR related expenses have a longer payback period.But with deceleration in revenue growth and acceleration in expense growth, management expects a hit to profitability. This could be a conservative estimate, but it’s enough to be concerned about, especially considering the privacy, security and fake news issues Facebook has been caught up in recently.Facebook is overvalued except on the basis of PEG.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

       " \"Successful investors generally overweight growth stocks, and it's easy to see why: Growth stocks are shares of companies that are growing their sales and profits faster than the industry and the market at large, which eventually leads to solid capital appreciation and rich rewards for shareholders. More often than not, the longer you hold growth stocks, the higher your returns.So we asked three Motley Fool contributors to recommend growth stocks for the long term. They offered some solid ideas from diverse industries: A.O. Smith (NYSE: AOS), Trex Company (NYSE: TREX), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).Neha Chamaria (A.O. Smith): In a world where tech stocks rule the high-flyer list, would you believe that a water-heater manufacturer's shares have risen a whopping 800% in just the past ten years? A.O. Smith has been the dark horse of the industrials sector, and it's likely to continue growing rapidly. The reason: a massive addressable market in some of the fastest-growing economies.After cornering the water-heater market in North America, A.O. Smith has now set its eyes on countries like China and India, where rising disposable incomes and expanding middle and upper classes are driving demand for consumer durables like purifiers and heaters. A.O. Smith's sales from China topped $1 billion last year, thanks to its more than 9,000 retail counters, and e-commerce that brought in almost a quarter of those sales.Buying and holding growth stocks for the long term can prove richly rewarding. Image source: Getty Images.These numbers show how aggressively A.O. Smith is growing. In its most recent quarter, the company handily beat estimates and upgraded its adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) outlook for fiscal 2018, guiding for a solid 20% growth at the midpoint from last year. Between 2010 and 2017, A.O. Smith grew its adjusted EPS at a compound annual rate of 26%.A.O. recently hit another milestone -- that of becoming a Dividend Aristocrat, having increased its dividends for 25 consecutive years. Yet the company still plows back a major chunk of its profits into the business for growth, which can also be credited for almost all of the stock's gains over the years. That makes A.O. Smith a growth stock in the traditional sense of the word, and an excellent choice for the long haul.Jason Hall (Trex): Recycled-decking manufacturer Trex Company has made recent investors a lot of money:TREX data by YCharts.It's a rare investment that delivers over fourfold gains in a five-year period. Yet even with these remarkable returns Trex is worth buying right now, because its future remains very bright.The company has a dominant position in the wood-alternative decking industry, commanding over 40% of North American sales, but regular wood still makes up more than 85% of the total volume of decking lumber sold each year. That goes to show just how big the market opportunity really is for Trex, despite so many years of huge growth already.Furthermore, I expect the burgeoning population of millennial homebuyers could be a boon for the company, further accelerating future growth. Trex's value as a more environmentally friendly choice than virgin wood decking resonates with younger buyers. Add the significant reduction in maintenance and multiple decades of use before needing to replace it, and Trex is likely to appeal to an even higher portion of new homeowners in the years to come.With a huge lead over its competitors, a solid long-term opportunity for growth, and a great management team in place, Trex makes the cut as a top growth stock to buy now and hold for the long term.Ashraf Eassa (Microsoft): Software giant Microsoft, which you probably know as the maker of the popular Windows operating system and the ubiquitous Office productivity suite, is a large and extremely profitable company that pays a respectable dividend (as of this writing, Microsoft shares yield 1.58%). What might be more interesting, though, is that Microsoft has also delivered a substantial amount of revenue growth during its life as a publicly traded company:MSFT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.That growth continued during its most recent fiscal year, with the software giant raking in $110.4 billion in revenue -- a figure that was up 14% from the company's prior fiscal year. It also churned out $35.1 billion in operating income -- a 21% year-over-year boost. Not only is Microsoft showing that it can deliver respectable revenue growth, but it's translating that revenue growth into fat profits for its shareholders, something that it's historically proven it can do well:MSFT Operating Income (TTM) data by YCharts.Digging deeper into the company's fiscal-year 2018 results, we see that each of its three major reporting segments delivered double-digit year-over-year growth rates:Data source: Microsoft fiscal fourth-quarter 2018 earnings release.The fact that Microsoft's growth comes from a diverse set of businesses, rather than from a single superstrong business while the others languish, seems like a good thing.Looking ahead, analysts expect Microsoft to enjoy 11.2% revenue growth during its fiscal year 2019 (the year that just started), then add another 10.3% revenue growth on top of that during its fiscal year 2020. The software giant's EPS is also expected to grow by 10.3% and 14.7%, respectively, during those years.Microsoft has a solid track record of delivering both revenue and profit growth over a long period of time. So if you're looking for a growth stock that you can count on to be here today, tomorrow, and likely ten years from now, the software giant is worth a look.More From The Motley FoolTeresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors; LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft.

       " 'Getty ImagesIt\\'s easy to identify the hottest tech stocks of today, but it\\'s much more difficult to look several years through the fog and determine who\\'ll still be on top.But RBC Capital\\'s analysts have just released a fascinating report, \"Imagine: 2025,\" highlighting tech stocks they believe will outperform all the way through 2025.This requires a different set of criteria than would be used for short-term tech analysis. Writes RBC: \"Equity valuations are based on the present value of future cash flows. Most analysis is focused on the next quarter or 1-2 years, but rarely is time and effort taken to think about the next 7 years when assessing the valuation of a company.\"This involves 1) identifying themes and norms that will become standard by 2025; and 2) identifying forward-thinking companies most boldly and effectively positioned for this new future.Here are 10 of the top tech stocks to buy for future growth, according to RBC Capital. We\\'ll also use TipRanks market data to understand whether now is a compelling time to invest in these technology companies.Getty ImagesMarket value: $872.6 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $2,097.97 (18% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Strong Buy (See Details)Amazon.com (AMZN, $1,777.44), along with Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), has invested the most heavily in artificial intelligence, writes RBC Capital. And unlike smaller rivals, AMZN also boasts \"the Big Data access and Compute Power infrastructure to benefit the most from AI and ML (machine learning) deployments.\"The sheer size of Amazon\\'s markets means the company still has a very strong growth outlook, too. RBC writes, \"AMZN faces the most large TAMs (total addressable markets) among the Internet companies -- Retail, Cloud, Advertising, Shipping & Logistics, Business Supplies, etc.\"For example, Amazon holds just a 10% share of the massive $20 trillion retail market, and a 10% share of the $1 trillion cloud market.RBC\\'s conclusion: Amazon is quickly making its way toward a $1 trillion market cap. Indeed, on very strong Q2 results, top RBC analyst Mark Mahaney (view Mahaney\\'s TipRanks profile) ramped up his price target from $1,900 to $2,100 per share.The stock has already posted a remarkable year-to-date run of more than 50%.Getty ImagesMarket value: $486.3 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $209.09 (21% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Strong Buy (See Details)Don\\'t unfriend Facebook (FB, $172.58) just yet.Facebook\\'s shares have been leveled by about 20% following a disappointing second-quarter earnings report. But long-term, the picture remains extremely compelling, and RBC thinks now is the time to jump in.\"This likely constitutes One of the Best Entry Points you can get on FB, in our view,\" RBC\\'s Mahaney wrote after shares\\' July 26 plunge. He has a $225 price target on the stock (32% upside potential).RBC Capital notes that Facebook has made substantial progress in its AI and ML efforts as it moves to capitalize on its massive scale and resources. \"The amount of user data FB can leverage - and we point to its 2B+ users on FB platform alone - we think gives the company a unique advantage,\" RBC writes. Facebook can use these new AI and ML capabilities to better refine their text analysis, ad targeting and newsfeed sorting, to name a few examples.Getty ImagesMarket value: $208.3 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $228.89 (16% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Strong Buy (See Details)As new markets and technologies flourish, RBC Capital predicts that by 2025, payment flows will surge to approximately $200 trillion - four times the current addressable market. And MasterCard (MA, $198.00) is perfectly positioned to reap the rewards.\"We believe MA (stands) as beacons of \\'Trust\\' around the world, which will enable them to capture a disproportionate amount of share in these new payment flows,\" RBC Capital writes.Indeed, RBC Capital\\'s Daniel Perlin (view Perlin\\'s TipRanks profile) already has highlighted MasterCard as a top pick. Following solid earnings results, this five-star analyst wrote, \"MasterCard remains one of our best ideas in the space given our belief that investors should look to focus on long-term, secular-driven stories that provide solid organic growth with opportunities for margin expansion.\"So far, his bet is on the money. MA is up 32% since the start of the year.Getty ImagesMarket value: $61.8 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $84.68 (60% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Strong Buy (See Details)Red-hot chip stock Micron (MU, $52.79) manufactures semiconductor devices, primarily NAND and DRAM memory. Luckily for MU, all roads in 2025 lead to data creation, says RBC Capital.\"To the extent that transpires we see MU with their DRAM * NAND portfolio as well positioned,\" its analysts write.While DRAM markets historically have gone through severe boom/bust cycles, RBC Capital is confident that the cycle(s) going forward will be more muted and less volatile. \"This inherently means that memory companies broadly should earn more profits and FCF over the cycle than historical trends would suggest\" writes RBC analyst Amit Daryanani (view Daryanani\\'s TipRanks profile). He has an $83 price target on the stock, implying 57% upside potential.That would be quite the feather in the cap of current shareholders, who are already enjoying 87% returns over the past 52 weeks.Getty ImagesMarket value: $814.4 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $120.63 (14% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Strong Buy (See Details)For RBC Capital, Microsoft (MSFT, $106.08) represents a \"leading hyperscale hybrid cloud platform with big runway of growth in AI, IoT, Gaming and other services.\"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told investors at a recent conference: \"AI is going to be one of the trends that is going to be the next big shift in technology.\" He is placing AI at the heart of Microsoft\\'s strategy and product development. \"It\\'s going to be AI at the edge, AI in the cloud, AI as part of SaaS applications, AI as part of, in fact, even infrastructure,\" Nadella said.Already, Microsoft\\'s Azure cloud platform powers multiple AI projects, including enabling developers to create powerful artificial-intelligence applications and chatbots. One example: Microsoft\\'s Cognitive Services, which enables developers to easily add AI capabilities such as speech recognition, voice synthesis and search to their applications.So far, these efforts (and others) are paying off; MSFT stock is up 23% year-to-date.Getty ImagesMarket value: $147.4 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $397.61 (18% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Moderate Buy (See Details)Like Facebook, Netflix (NFLX, $337.45) disappointed investors with its most recent earnings report; shares are now down 15% during the past few weeks after the streaming-video company reported lower-than-expected subscriber additions.But RBC\\'s Mark Mahaney (view Mahaney\\'s TipRanks profile) thinks the bull story behind NFLX - which still is up 70% year-to-date - remains firmly intact.\"After 4 very strong quarters, Netflix had a weak Q2. We\\'ve seen this story before (i.e. Q2:16), but note that long-term fundamental trends remain intact, and Q2 generally has some lumpiness,\" Mahaney writes, maintaining a \"Buy\" rating and a $360 price target.Longer-term, RBC believes Netflix is heading in the right direction with its AI focus. \"Given its 120MM subscriber base, NFLX has the data and resources to leverage AI technology,\" its analysts write. \"Today NFLX uses AI technology for content promotion and targeting, content price optimization, programmatic marketing, and improving streaming quality, to name a few.\"\"One of the company\\'s experiments (includes) creating software-edited trailers that are personalized for each subscriber, increasing the likelihood of those viewers to watch the movie,\" RBC writes.Getty ImagesMarket value: $148.8 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $292.82 (20% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Moderate Buy (See Details)RBC calls Nvidia (NVDA, $244.86) a \"leader in AI.\"Nvidia\\'s graphics processing unit (GPU) chips are perhaps best-known for their gaming capabilities, but they\\'re increasingly being used for data-heavy AI applications. GPUs are the engines of visual computing; they enable computers to understand, create and enhance images. As a result, these chips play a role in everything from gaming to data centers to self-driving vehicles.The best part is that a strong competitor has yet to emerge, especially in self-driving, where RBC sees Nvidia emerging as the \"winner.\"Indeed, Nvidia is ramping up its auto efforts to take advantage of the shift to smart cars with complex data needs: Think speech-to-text interface, internet-connected devices, proximity sensing, and self-driving potential as well as increasingly advanced display technologies.NVDA has been among the best tech stocks of the past couple years, up 320% since this point in 2016. But analysts broadly see at least 20% more upside potential from here, and those targets might continue to climb if Nvidia continues to trounce expectations.Getty ImagesMarket value: $98.2 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $97.46 (18% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Strong Buy (See Details)PayPal (PYPL, $82.14) is all set to tap the long-term global shift to digital commerce. Not only is it a champion of worldwide democratized finance, but it also is capitalizing on the digitization of retail and financial services. \"We believe PayPal\\'s above peer growth rates should be sustainable and could accelerate with incremental capital deployment, given its strong cash position,\" RBC\\'s Daniel Perlin writes.PayPal differentiates itself from competitors by offering an open platform that is designed for both merchant and consumers, the analyst firm says. \"PYPL brings scale and a unique two-sided model (relationships with both consumers and merchants), which allows them to control the entire consumer experience.\"So while PayPal is reeling in the short-term following sales guidance that fell short of analysts\\' hopes, RBC still thinks PayPal will play a critical role in tapping the roughly 2 billion people around the world who lack financial services. In fact, Perlin actually ramped up his price target from $87 to $95 shortly after PayPal\\'s report.Courtesy Satyaki.snow via Wikimedia CommonsMarket value: $31.7 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $202.37 (15% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Strong Buy (See Details)This rapidly growing IT cloud company still is up more than 30% year-to-date despite a post-earnings retreat. Essentially, ServiceNow (NOW, $175.96) transforms information technology for global businesses by managing all their IT service relationships. This can involve creating a single system of record for IT and automating manual tasks, or standardizing processes and consolidating legacy systems.\"We think NOW is exposed to large and growing areas of spend in several next-gen areas including automation and machine learning,\" writes RBC Capital. The firm calls ServiceNow a \"favorite\" because the company \"is operating at a different gear than peers as the flywheel of a true multi-product and profitable platform company spins at a rapid rate.\"RBC spies big potential for the company to expand outside the IT world. \"ServiceNow could become the platform for the enterprise as customers and partners write custom SaaS applications for HR, finance, facilities, legal, procurement, etc. on its platform.\"RBC\\'s Matthew Hedberg (view Hedberg\\'s TipRanks profile) boosted his price target from $200 to $205 on July 26 following a mixed earnings report that included top- and bottom-line beats, but also light guidance.Getty ImagesMarket value: $14.3 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $126.27 (32% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Strong Buy (See Details)Splunk (SPLK, $96.10) provides a software platform for real-time operational intelligence. More than 9,500 customers around the world use Splunk in multiple ways, from deepening customer understanding to cutting cybersecurity risk and fraud.\"We are bullish on Splunk\\'s ability to grow and take share in a new market that we call operational intelligence ... it\\'s about gaining actionable insight to make better business decisions by harnessing the full power of data,\" RBC writes. Looking toward the future, \"We think SPLK is well positioned as a hybrid-cloud data management platform that can leverage massive data-sets and harness machine learning trends better than most.\"In May, the company beat first-quarter profit and revenue estimates and also beat expectations for Q2 guidance. That prompted Matthew Hedberg to reiterate his \"Buy\" rating with a new $125 price target. Investors will get to see Splunk\\'s fiscal second-quarter results after the Aug. 23 closing bell.Note: RBC included five other tech stocks in its report: Alphabet, Apple (AAPL), Synopsis (SNPS), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Visa (V).EDITOR\\'S PICKSCopyright 2018 The Kiplinger Washington Editors',\n",
