Coffee, director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia Law School. “But if he can’t prove that, he’s in some danger of a big lawsuit because short sellers will be devastated by this.”On Aug. 7, Musk tweeted: “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” Those nine words sent the stock soaring from $342 to around $370, an 8% jump. Then the Nasdaq exchange temporarily halted trading in the shares, pending clarification of material news by the company.About three hours after his momentous tweet, Musk posted a message to employees explaining his rationale for going private. He cited “wild swings” in the stock price and frequent attacks by short sellers as “a\\xa0major distraction for everyone working at Tesla.” He said Space X, the\\xa0rocket-launching company where Musk is also CEO, is an example of a privately-owned company better able to focus on a complex long-term mission, and a possible model for Tesla. “A final decision has not yet been made,” he said. Trading on the NASDAQ resumed after Tesla posted the message.Tesla is both a loved and hated stock, with backers extolling Musks’s visionary ideas and critics waiting for the company to run out of money and collapse. Short interest in the company—traders betting the stock will go down—represent 20% of shares outstanding. That’s high. Short interest is just 1.7% at General Motors and 0.9% at Apple. Musk has called short-sellers “haters” and accused them of trying to wreck his company.[See why the Tesla Model 3 will be a great car–some day.]If Musk’s aim was to temporarily boost Tesla’s stock in order to force losses on short sellers, it could be considered stock manipulation, which is illegal. “That’s too inviting to a plaintiff’s lawyer not to sue,” says Coffee. “This would be an attractive lawsuit. The people who think he’s manipulating the market would say they’ve suffered an injury, and you could pull all those losses together in a class action.”If, on the other hand, Musk can demonstrate that he has actually arranged financing for a private buyout, or made serious efforts to do so, he might be off the hook.Shortly before Musk posted his tweet, the Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund has bought about $2 billion worth of Tesla shares, representing a 4.5% stake in the company. So Saudi money could be part of a buyout offer.Musk will now be under pressure to promptly disclose whether a buyout offer is serious and where the money would come from. The company is worth about $62 billion (after the Musk-tweet surge), and there would likely be a premium of 25% or more to entice current holders to sell, and give up future gains. At Musk’s price of $420 per share, the buyout would value the company at\\xa0 around $71 billion.Going private might make sense for Tesla, which has struggled with long-term investments while Wall Street analysts demand profitability. “Musk does not want to run a public company,” analyst Gene Munster of Loup Ventures wrote to clients after Musk’s privatization tweet. “His mission for Tesla (to accelerate the globe’s adoption of sustainable energy) is both grand and long-term, making it difficult to accommodate\\xa0investors’ quarterly expectations.” Munster thinks there’s a one-third chance the company actually does go private, and thinks the price might have to be higher to get shareholders, and the board, to bite.That’s if Musk is serious.Confidential tip line:\\xa0rickjnewman@yahoo.com.\\xa0Click here to\\xa0get Rick’s stories by email.Read more:Rick Newman is the author of four books, including “Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.” Follow him on Twitter:\\xa0@rickjnewmanFollow Yahoo Finance on\\xa0Facebook,\\xa0Twitter,\\xa0Instagram, and LinkedIn'],\n",

       "  'CHICAGO (AP) — Children\\'s advocates want the American Psychological Association to condemn the tech industry\\'s practice of using persuasive psychological techniques to keep kids glued to their screens.The advocates, citing research that links excessive use of social media and video games with depression and academic troubles, say it\\'s unethical for psychologists to be involved in tactics that risk harming kids\\' well-being. Skeptics say the research is inconclusive, and they note that psychologists have been involved in other industries\\' marketing and advertising for decades.The group seeking intervention includes 60 U.S. psychologists, researchers, children\\'s advocates and the Children\\'s Screen Time Action Network, a project of the Boston-based Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The network was publishing a letter Wednesday to the American Psychological Association, coinciding with the association\\'s annual meeting in San Francisco.\"There are powerful psychology principles and technology that are being used against kids in ways that are not in their best interests,\" said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.That technology uses computers to help figure out what motivates people and influence their online behavior. It\\'s built on age-old tenets of behavioral psychology that marketers and advertisers have long used to get people to buy their products. The difference is smartphones are ubiquitous and unlike human marketers, they don\\'t get tired, said B.J. Fogg, a behavioral scientist at Stanford University who has been called the technology\\'s pioneer.Fogg said he has aimed to use persuasive tech to enhance people\\'s lives. But he also said he has long warned that it has a \"dark side,\" including potential loss of privacy and the potential for encouraging behavior that isn\\'t in users\\' best interests.The letter to the psychology association cites a recent study that found that teen girls who spend a lot of time on digital devices, including on social media, are at risk for depression and suicidal behaviors. That study couldn\\'t show whether depressed girls might be more prone to using social media than other teens.The letter also notes evidence that some teen boys overuse video games \"at the expense of obtaining real-world competencies,\" including college educations and jobs.\"Families don\\'t understand why their kids are so strongly attracted and pulled to these devices,\" said Richard Freed, a Walnut Creek, California, psychologist who signed the letter. He said the World Health Organization\\'s decision in June to declare excessive video gaming an addiction shows that the problem is real.Under Fogg\\'s model, technology can change a person\\'s behavior by tapping into hard-wired motivations, simplifying the activity and getting people to perform it with a \"well-timed\" trigger. That could mean an app prompting a person to go running or it could be an alert persuading someone to spend more time on social media based on their innate desire to win acceptance and avoid social rejection.It\\'s not just the big tech firms. BuzzFeed reported Tuesday, based on a confidential company memo, that founders of a startup recently acquired by Facebook boasted of using a \"psychological trick\" — custom social media profiles and mysterious calls to action — to get high schoolers to download a polling app. Facebook later shut down the app.In job postings, big tech companies have sought psychologists and people with psychology training for research into user experiences. Microsoft\\'s Xbox user research division is led by psychologists. Amazon looks for hires who \"geek out over user research, psychology, ethnography.\" Google\\'s preferred qualification for some positions includes a doctorate in experimental psychology.\"We strive to learn and understand our users\\' needs, behaviors, and emotions to yield insights that inform product strategy and guide the design of the experiences we create,\" says one Google job posting online this week.Facebook and Google didn\\'t return requests for comment Tuesday on whether they use psychological persuasion techniques to build digital products for children. Microsoft, Apple and Amazon declined to comment.This year, those companies have promoted better digital well-being amid rising concerns about kids\\' digital distractions.The Internet Association, an industry trade group, said its member companies endeavor to create safe and positive online experiences.\"This is an important conversation, and the internet industry remains committed to developing and sharing best practices, partnering and collaborating with experts, and developing resources and programs that will ensure positive online experiences,\" the association\\'s Noah Theran said in the statement.Apple is introducing new tools meant to make its iPhone less addictive after two major shareholders earlier this year called on the company to curb smartphone addiction among children. Facebook, YouTube and Microsoft have introduced similar tools.The American Psychological Association has no policy on using psychological research to develop persuasive digital technology.But in a statement responding to the advocates\\' letter, association CEO Arthur Evans Jr. said the group \"is concerned about the increasing amount of time children are spending on digital devices.\"He said the association is examining psychology\\'s role in technology development, and that an association committee will discuss the letter and whether to recommend any action.___O\\'Brien reported from Boston.

       "  'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-old-line-kroger-shows-050000308.html',\n",
       "  'By Lisa BaertleinCINCINNATI, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Kroger Co, the nation\\'s biggest supermarket chain, whose founder delivered groceries by horse and buggy, is using a different kind of horsepower in its race with online grocery sellers.The 135-year-old company is experimenting with a variety of technologies as it battles Amazon.com and Walmart Inc to find a profitable formula to serve customers who want milk and eggs whisked to their doorsteps. These shoppers are a tiny but fast-growing segment of the $800-billion U.S. grocery market. Kroger must win them over to survive.\"We want to serve the customer on their terms,\" said Chief Executive Rodney McMullen, who for years has kept tabs on the economics of grocery delivery. \"For us, every penny counts.\"In a series of interviews with Reuters at Kroger headquarters in Cincinnati, McMullen and other executives outlined a host of experiments and initiatives. These include self-driving delivery vans, third-party delivery contractors and curbside pickup in Kroger parking lots. Most of these efforts are an attempt to leverage one of the company\\'s most valuable assets: brick-and-mortar stores located within a mile or two of most of its current customers.But Kroger is breaking with that familiar model for its next big push. It is betting big on giant warehouses staffed with fast robots to pack orders straight for delivery to shoppers.In May, Kroger paid roughly $248 million for a minority stake in Ocado, a British company whose newest machines can pull together a 50-item grocery order in as little as five minutes. That technology leapfrogs what is currently in use by any retailer in the United States. It has turned Ocado into the world\\'s No. 1 online grocer, serving 679,000 active customers in the United Kingdom without operating a single supermarket.This year Kroger and Ocado will pick U.S. sites for the first three of 20 planned high-tech warehouses, known as \"sheds,\" that take a couple of years to build, Kroger executives said. They declined to name locations, but said Kroger plans to break into at least one new area where it does not have existing stores.Industry veterans said Kroger\\'s partnership with Ocado was a bold move that positions the company, which posted 2017 sales of $123 billion, to grab share from younger players seen as nimbler and more innovative.\"This will be a game-changer ... and probably the most likely catalyst for grocery e-commerce in the U.S. to take off,\" said London-based Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, a former e-commerce executive at British food seller Tesco.Kroger executives would not say whether they will use their own drivers or outsource delivery from the sheds.Meanwhile, the company has teamed up with Silicon Valley self-driving startup Nuro to test a driverless delivery van in Phoenix. And Kroger continues to invest in curbside pickup.Earlier this month it launched a beefed-up online shopping service called Kroger Ship that sends packages directly from its distribution centers via United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp.But competitors are not sitting still.Walmart, which waged a brutal price war to become the top U.S. grocery seller, recently launched its own self-driving car project. Later this year it will begin testing automated grocery picking at a supercenter in Salem, New Hampshire.Amazon, meanwhile, already sells more non-perishable groceries online than any other retailer. It spent $13.7 billion last year to acquire the Whole Foods supermarket chain with an eye to turning those stores into distribution hubs to bolster its AmazonFresh delivery service. The company just launched curbside pickup at Whole Foods, starting with stores in Sacramento, California and Virginia Beach, Virginia.DEMAND DILEMMAIt is all largely a bet on the future.Analysts say online grocery purchases currently account for just 1 percent to 4 percent of U.S. industry sales. Three-quarters of online shoppers surveyed said they rarely or never buy groceries that way, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos telephone poll of nearly 6,000 adults fielded from June 26 to July 11.(For a look at why U.S. shoppers are not buying groceries online, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LYQUUV)Investment in automation has spurred faster growth overseas. Online grocery sales account for 5.6 percent of the market in the United Kingdom and 3.8 percent in China, compared to 1 percent in the United States, according to market research firm IGD Retail.Kroger is letting go of old models that have proven unprofitable.Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman revealed for the first time that the company never made money on Home Shop, a roughly 30-year-old delivery service it shuttered in April. Kroger offered it in just 20 stores in the company\\'s King Soopers division in the Rocky Mountain area, for prices ranging from $10.95 for an internet order to $20.90 for telephone orders. That was not enough to cover the cost of labor and the expense of operating a fleet of refrigerated trucks.\"It\\'s highly inefficient to do that out of a store. You can\\'t get the critical mass you need,\" Schlotman said.Kroger replaced Home Shop with Instacart, one of a handful of third-party delivery firms that now serve more than 1,200 Kroger stores.Monteyne, the supermarket analyst, said Kroger\\'s new delivery push is a recognition of the value of online shoppers. These customers crave convenience and tend to spend more per order than those who just drop by the supermarket for a few items. The \"first-mover\" advantage is key to locking them in.That is how Kroger lost Cincinnati shopper Alene Annan, 50. Tired of hauling dog food and Diet Coke up two flights of steps to her home, she switched to Meijer Inc, which was among the first stores to offer delivery in her area.Still, she said she is open to switching back to Kroger when its new service is ready.\"They just have to make it easy,\" Annan said.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Vanessa O\\'Connell and Marla Dickerson)'],\n",

       "  \"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Wednesday said it was launching curbside pickup at Whole Foods stores, in its latest tactic to win over U.S. grocery shoppers.Customers can place orders via Amazon's Prime Now app and ask to have groceries loaded into their car upon arrival at a store, the company said in a statement. The service is now available in Sacramento, California, and in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with plans to launch in other cities this year.The world's largest online retailer is working to crack the $800 billion (£618.38 billion) market for U.S. groceries by popularizing delivery from Whole Foods stores, and now pickup. Cheaper than delivery, pickup has long been touted by far larger grocery companies Kroger Co (KR.N) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N), which have been rolling out the service to thousands of stores.Whole Foods has 467 U.S. stores and roughly 1 percent share of the fragmented U.S. grocery market. Amazon bought the chain last year in a $13.7 billion deal, and since then it has lowered prices and added delivery services so it could begin capturing shoppers' weekly spending on groceries.Customers of the new pickup service will get designated parking spots at stores, Amazon said. They must be members of Amazon's subscription club Prime to use the service.Amazon said pickup in an hour is free for orders of at least $35, while pickup in 30 minutes costs $4.99.(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin and Lisa Baertlein; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\"],\n",

       "  'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-expect-disappointing-second-quarter-snap-194158682.html',\n",
       "  'Snap (SNAP) shares were up over 11% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the social-media company beat earnings estimates\\xa0but\\xa0disappointed on\\xa0user growth.The Venice, California-based tech company\\xa0announced\\xa0less of a loss than Wall Street analysts predicted: $.14 per share on\\xa0revenues of\\xa0$262 million compared with\\xa0analysts’ expectations\\xa0of\\xa0$.17 per share on revenues of\\xa0$251 million. However for the first time ever, Snap reported a sequential decline in daily active users, dropping from 191 million DAUs in the first quarter to 188 million DAUs in the second quarter — a stark contrast from analysts, who had estimated a gain of nearly 2 million users.“Although we saw our monthly active users increase, our daily active users declined by 2%,” Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said on the earnings call on Tuesday, attributing the dip to a “slightly lower\\xa0frequency of use” due to a controversial redesign rolled out late last year.During the company’s second quarter, Snap introduced a redesigned Snapchat app aimed at addressing criticisms lobbed at a more radical app update rolled out late last year that separated the app into two distinct feeds. The company also introduced a new version of its Spectacles camera glasses in its ongoing effort to expand beyond the smartphone.Given Snap’s lackluster performance since the company went public in March 2017, a significant number of Wall Street analysts remain bearish: Snap currently has 6 buys, 18 holds and 11 sell ratings from analysts.Snap hasn’t had an easy path since Snapchat launched in 2011. Although the ephemeral messaging app quickly gained popularity in earlier years among teens and millennials seeking a more private, hipper alternative to Facebook (FB), the company has had trouble consistently delivering significant user and revenues growth to investors since it debuted as a publicly-traded company. Chalk much of those challenges up to Facebook’s cribbing of Snapchat Stories, last November’s maligned app update and the initial disappointing launch of Spectacles.Along with Snap’s mixed results on Tuesday, however, came some positive news for the company in the form of a $250 million investment from Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Abdulaziz AlSaud, a member of Saudi Arabia’s royal family, in exchange for a 2.3% stake in Snap.إستثمرت ٩٥٠ مليون ريال سعودي لاتمام صفقة شراء حصة بنسبة ٢,٣٪ في شركة سناب شاتhttps://t.co/XXOgEvEB2WI invested $250 Million to acquire 2.3% stake in @Snapchat companyhttps://t.co/bdAMGVw3DI pic.twitter.com/jBIiAfqy7t— الوليد بن طلال (@Alwaleed_Talal) August 7, 2018—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business.\\xa0Email story tips and musings to\\xa0jpm@oath.com.\\xa0Follow him on\\xa0Twitter\\xa0or\\xa0Facebook.More from JP:'],\n",

       "  'This post has been updated.Trying to take a hiatus from social media? If you’re finding Facebook the hardest to leave, you’re not alone.According to new data from The Harris Poll, the giant social network\\xa0ranked the highest in a new survey that looked at the social media apps that people find the hardest to break away from. (Facebook has\\xa02.2 billion monthly active users.)The survey looked at 2,043 adults aged 18 and older in the U.S. and found that 49% of respondents found Facebook (FB) the hardest to abstain from, followed by YouTube (parent company: GOOGL), Instagram, and Twitter (TWTR).The results varied slightly by gender. Across all ages, women found it more difficult than men to break away from Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest. Men,\\xa0meanwhile, found it more difficult than women to unplug from YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Tinder.Sean Parker, an early Facebook investor and its first president, explained that Facebook was designed to play on dopamine, a chemical produced by our brains that motivates repeated behaviors.“The thought process was all about, ‘How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?’” Parker told Mike Allen of Axios in November 2017. “And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever, and that’s going to get you to contribute more content, and that’s going to get you more likes and comments. It’s a social validation feedback loop. … You’re exploiting a\\xa0vulnerability in human psychology.”Trevor Haynes, a research technician in the department of neurobiology at Harvard Medical School, further explained that “companies like Facebook will continue to do everything they can to keep your eyes glued to the screen as often as possible. And by using algorithms to leverage our dopamine-driven reward circuitry, they stack the cards — and our brains — against us.”And taking away those dopamine\\xa0hits brings its own downside: 31% of respondents to The Harris Poll said they grew anxious when they didn’t check social media regularly.Facebook, fully aware of its\\xa0integration into people’s lives, is reportedly looking to\\xa0deepen links with financial institutions to help with customer service.“Facebook is nothing but an advertising platform,” Yahoo Finance Editor-In-Chief Andy Serwer explained on the Final Round. “And at some point, some way, somehow they’re going to have to get away from that\\xa0and get into businesses that are either membership-, subscriber-based, or e-commerce, or transactions, or something like that.“And, we all know, financial services is arguably the biggest business on the planet. And they already have some inroads. So I think there is some excitement by the marketplace that they’re looking to push out in this direction.”The Harris Poll\\xa0noted that\\xa061% of millennials say they’d take more digital detoxes if their friends and/or family did it with them.Some were so attached — 27% according to the survey — that they’d even “take a pay cut to work at a company that enforced digital restrictions for employees.”\\xa0Overall, 47% of respondents wished their companies had digital detox policies that restricted emails on weekends.Others have taken it to the extreme and deleted their social media accounts: 4 in 10 respondents in a recent\\xa0survey by Edelman said that they deleted at least one social media account in the past year.\\xa0And according to Pivotal Research, the aggregated time spent on Facebook and Messenger fell 10% in June.But most users remain committed to the giant social network — as the data show — to the extent that they’d rather not stay away for long.Follow Aarthi on Twitter.Read more:'],\n",

       "  'India’s coming demand that the Cloud Czars store all data on Indians locally, and build new data centers to do it, isn’t that new.Switzerland has been doing it for years, and data center providers both large\\xa0and small\\xa0have been building there.India’s move, based on a new data protection bill, to demand that data on Indians stay in India\\xa0is going to shake up the entire data processing business in the country, but most of the assumptions concerning that shakeup are wrong.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Cambridge Analytica scandal is being blamed for the moves, but this is as much about demanding construction of local computing infrastructure as it is about protecting elections.The three largest cloud service providers,\\xa0Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), already have scaled data centers in India.Amazon has been in India since 2016, through a “cloud region” in Mumbai.\\xa0Google has a Mumbai data center, and Microsoft has created three India regions. Even IBM\\xa0(NYSE:IBM) has two centers.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), however, only has a development center in Hyderabad and may be moved to build a data center. Facebook has no data centers in India. It may have to build one or buy an existing provider. Or both could hook up with one of their fellow czars. Smaller companies will also have to tie up with a provider who has facilities in India to participate in the market.Chinese companies are also active in India, with both\\xa0TenCent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) having launched there.While serving India won’t be a huge problem for the Cloud Czars, it’s part of a trend that could become expensive, as other countries all demand what India has. Serving a market of a billion people is attractive, but when smaller countries make the same demand, meeting it degrades the scaled advantages of having a cloud in the first place.The real targets of India’s data localization moves aren’t the czars at all. It’s the big U.S. payment processors, companies like Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), that are behind the eight ball. All of them have been protesting a central bank directive demanding localization for months.India’s move to eliminate high-denomination notes, called demonetization, has jump-started the market for phone-based payments, which is expected to become a $1-trillion market by 2023.India’s homegrown Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which acts against bank accounts without the need for a gateway, is being integrated into the Cloud Czars’ apps but has also built local companies like PhonePE and PayTM into scaled competitors.PhonePE is owned by Flipkart, which is mostly owned by Walmart (NYSE:WMT). PayTM is said to be worth $10 billion, with investment from Alibaba and SoftBank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY), although it remains locally controlled.The U.S. payment giants are thus faced with two problems, getting local and maintaining market share where they don’t control the fastest-growing payments gateway.The Indian move is one which guarantees the rich get richer.The companies that will dominate cloud hosting are already in the country. The big U.S. services that need localized hosting can afford to build it.The danger is not what India is doing today, but what countries like Vietnam, Pakistan, Argentina, Indonesia and Brazil may do tomorrow in demanding local control of locally generated data. Even the Cloud Czars don’t have data centers in all these markets. Building them will be expensive. Buying local providers will take time, but it may well be the way they go.And payments represent an even bigger headache. If India’s move to set up its own phone gateway is emulated by other countries, and they then move to demand data localization, it could be very bearish for the U.S. payment leaders and the processors which are their followers.Dana Blankenhorn\\xa0is a financial and technology journalist.

       "  'After Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) first disclosed its accounting problems in May, the stock quickly tanked and fell below $20 a share. And prior to its earnings report issued last week, it looked as though the stock would hold the $20 threshold.That hope evaporated when the company reported poor first quarter results and lowered guidance in the second quarter. Now with a forward P/E of 11, SYMC stock is well below fair value.Symantec forecast full-year revenue would fall below the $4.83 billion consensus estimates and in the range of $4.67-$4.79 billion. For the second quarter, revenue will not meet the $1.19 billion expectations. Instead, revenue will be in the range of $1.13-$1.16 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCEO Greg Clark reasoned the miss is due to large, multi-platform sales taking longer to close. The lower enterprise billings, which dropped from $646 million last year to $556 million in the quarter, could persist if business drags again in North America.Despite the revenue miss, Symantec’s cash flow from operations rose to $334 million, up from $213 million, sequentially. ARPU will grow, thanks to Symantec’s Consumer Digital Strategy.If the large deal closings did not get delayed, the company would have reported solid revenue growth from its Integrated Cyber Defense platform. But due to the shortfall, sales fell 20% from last year to $111 million.Symantec, like other software companies, namely Adobe\\xa0(NASDAQ:ADBE) with its Creative Suite and\\xa0Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Office365, is lowering the barrier of adoption by porting its products to the cloud.Cloud Proxy, CASB, and Data Protection, as well as multi-factor authentication, are some of the parts of the security stack that will ease customer adoption of Symantec products to the cloud.In the first quarter, Symantec signed a contract with a multinational food and beverage company that adopted its Cloud Proxy. The user base of nearly 100,000 is proof that more enterprise customers will sign deals of that size in the coming quarters.Yet, with SYMC stock trading at just 11 times forward earnings, markets have little faith that the anti-virus and cybersecurity specialist will win more large-size deals.According to Tipranks, the average price target on SYMC stock is $21.62, or upside of nearly 11% from its recent price of around $19.50. Conversely, a 10-year revenue exit model would peg the company’s fair value as close to $30 a share, or upside of over 50%.To get the stock close to the fair value in the $30 range, Symantec clearly needs better revenue growth and higher EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. And after the lowered forecast, investors will have to wait beyond this year before expecting such lofty profit margin growth.For the fiscal year 2019, operating margin will reach no higher than 30%, compared to the previous 30-32% forecast.In fiscal 2020, Symantec forecasts profit margin improving to the mid-30% range. This view is supported by expectations of sales from both the Enterprise Security and Consumer Digital Safety segments picking up sharply. In the short term, Symantec will cut headcount globally by 8% and take a $50-million charge to reach those longer-term targets.Symantec came up short in its revenue numbers this quarter when renewable billings and sales from new business did not meet expectations. This cost the company $110 million in business. Yet the 7% drop last week on top of the 43% drop from yearly highs prices in the downside risks.SYMC stock could even become a takeover target. Its market cap of $12.7 billion could attract a mega-cap company that is looking for growth in the software space and willing to pay under three times sales.Disclosure: The author does not own shares in any of the companies mentioned.Compare BrokersThe post After the Dip, Symantec Stock Could Have at Least 30% Upside appeared first on InvestorPlace.'],\n",

After a 0.28 percent rise on Tuesday, the S&P 500 was up almost 7 percent in 2018.A sharp rally in tech stocks has already helped the Nasdaq recover much faster than the broader markets from a sell-off in February, hitting a record high late last month.\"We might hit the record and blow through it. As long as there are still strong earnings and there are no corporate blowups, there\\'s nothing that says we have to stop. Momentum can go on for a long time,\" said Liz Young, senior investment strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York.The financial sector rose 0.48 percent as higher yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note buoyed bank stocks.\"Financials really have been trading a lot with the bond market. To the extent that bond yields go higher, specifically on the 10-year Treasury note you seem to see rallies in financials,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.The S&P 500 energy index gained 0.72 percent after U.S. sanctions on Iranian goods went into effect, intensifying concerns about supply.Google parent Alphabet rose 1.47 percent and Microsoft moved up 0.69 percent, driving a 0.33 percent gain in the S&P information and technology index.Amazon.com added 0.80 percent. The Internet retail and infrastructure heavyweight provided the greatest lift to the S&P 500, followed by Alphabet and Microsoft.Tesla jumped 10.99 percent after Chief Executive Elon Musk said he was considering taking the electric car maker private.A strong earnings season has helped U.S. stocks cushion some of the impact from the simmering trade issues.With the second-quarter reporting season winding down, 79 percent of S&P 500 companies have topped estimates. If the beat rate holds, it will be the highest on record, dating back to the first quarter of 1994, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 percent to end the day at 25,628.91 points.The S&P 500 ended the session at 2,858.45, just short of its January record of 2,872.87. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.31 percent to 7,883.66.The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street\\'s \"fear gauge,\" dropped to 10.93 points, its lowest since January.Broadridge Financial rose 11.16 percent and Mosaic climbed 5 percent after reporting quarterly results.Walt Disney added 0.53 percent ahead of its results, which were released after markets closed.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.29-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 104 new highs and 70 new lows.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.2 billion shares, compared with the 6.3 billion-share average for the last 20 trading days.
