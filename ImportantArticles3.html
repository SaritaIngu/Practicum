      <td>After shares of Netflix and Facebook took a beating late last month, there has been buzz about this being the right time for investors to move at least some of their money from growth stocks to value stocks.Consider these stories:• The stock market just experienced the most seismic shift from growth to value since Lehman Brothers, says Nomura.• Stock-market shift from growth to value ‘a meaningful bounce’ but not yet a ‘trend change.’• It’s finally time to shift some money into value stocks.Netflix NFLX, +0.50%  and Facebook FB, -1.13%  are two of the FAANG stocks — a group that also includes Apple AAPL, +0.79% Amazon.com AMZN, +0.64%  and Google holding company Alphabet GOOG, +0.28%GOOGL, +0.25%  These companies together have a market value of $3.6 trillion, making up an astonishing 13% of the S&P 500 Index’s total market value. Their rapid sales growth has been a major driver for increasingly popular index funds in recent years. So arguments for moving away from growth stocks often center on the FAANGs.The simplest way to divide stocks into growth and value camps is to divide the market in half by price-to-book-value ratios. The Russell 1000 Index RUI, -0.11%  is divided into the Russell 1000 Growth Index RLG, +0.01%  and the Russell 1000 Value Index RLV, -0.23%  using price/book as well as earnings growth forecasts and five years of sales per share.Also see: These 10 companies have recently raised their dividends by at least 10%There’s no question that during this bull market that began in March 2009, the growth approach has been a better performer for investors. Here are how the Russell 1000 Index, the Russell 1000 Growth Index and the Russell 1000 Value Index have performed over various periods:2018:Three years through Aug. 6:5 years:10 years:15 years:The value approach shows its value in the 20-year chart:So the Russell 1000 Value Index is the 20-year winner. However, it has only outperformed the full Russell 1000 by less than 1% for that entire period. This puts the entire growth-versus-value debate into question.Taking a broader look at the market, we divided the S&P 1500 Composite Index in half by the price/book ratio using data supplied by FactSet. (The S&P 1500 Composite Index is made up of the large-cap S&P 500, the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index MID, -0.11%  and the S&P Small-Cap 600 Index SML, +0.08% ). Any company with a negative book value, as per its most recently filed quarterly report through Aug. 6, was excluded. That left us with a group of 724 “value” stocks.Then we sorted this “value” group of companies by how much their sales per share had increased over the past 12 months from the previous 12-month period (assuming eight quarters of data were available). We looked at sales per share rather than raw revenue because the per-share numbers incorporate any dilution to the stock caused by the issuance of new shares. If a company funds an acquisition with new shares, the per-share numbers can give a better indication of whether the acquisition was “worth it” for the acquiring company’s shareholders.We then reviewed companies’ gross profit margins. A company’s gross margin is its sales, less the cost of goods or services sold, divided by sales. It does not take overhead expenses into account, but it is useful when considering the quality of a company’s core business. If sales growth comes as a result of a significant lowering of prices in the face of competition, the trend is not sustainable. It’s a healthy sign if a company’s sales are growing rapidly while its gross margin is widening. We excluded companies with negative gross margins either for the most recent 12 months or the year-earlier 12-month period.After applying the sales-per-share growth and gross margin screens, we were left with 22 companies in our S&P 1500 value group with sales per share rising by at least 30% over the past 12 months, while gross margins improved. Here they are, sorted by sales growth:It’s probably not a surprise to see 12 companies in the energy sector on the list, with the price of West Texas crude oil    CL1, -3.34%   rising 39% over the past year, through Aug. 6.It’s also worth noting how volatile some of these stocks have been this year, with 17 moving up or down by double digits. That movement underscores how important it is to form your own opinion (based on your own research) about a company’s long-term viability — think five years or a decade — before making an investment.Don’t miss: Fear the FAANG stocks?

      <td>Updated to add raw revenue growth to the tables.As we near the end of earnings season, two trends are clear: Profits have gone through the roof, helped by lower corporate income taxes. But sales have also increased remarkably, and that trend started before the tax cuts went into effect.About 18% of S&P 500 SPX, -0.14%  companies have fiscal quarter-end dates that don’t match the end dates of calendar quarters. Also, through Aug. 7, about 95% of S&P 500 companies had reported results for fiscal quarters ended April 27 or later.But that’s close enough for us to show a set of remarkable numbers. According to the most recently available quarterly data through Aug. 7, 267 S&P 500 companies increased their sales per share by 10% or more from a year earlier. Here’s the data going back eight quarters:That’s a pretty clear trend, and you can see a big move from the third quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter. The partial recovery of oil prices played a part. (West Texas crude oil CL1, -3.34%  hit a high of $107.68 a barrel in June 2014 and fell to a low of $26.05 in Feb. 2016 before recovering to $60.41 at the end of 2017 and closing at $69.17 on Aug. 7.)We have been looking at sales per share, rather than raw revenue, because a company’s sales might jump because of the acquisition of another large company. Acquisitions are often funded in whole or in part by the issuance of new shares by the acquiring company. So the per-share numbers can give a better indication of whether or not a merger was “worth it” to the acquiring company’s shareholders.While the per-share numbers reflect any dilution from the issuance of stock for any reason, they are also boosted by the repurchase of shares, which is an important trend that shows no signs of letting up.So while the tables below are sorted by increases in sales per share, we have added another column showing how much raw revenue increased.Here are the 37 S&P 500 companies (nearly half are energy companies) that increased their sales per share by 25% or more for their most recent reported quarters through Aug. 8, while also showing improved gross profit margins:You can click on the tickers for more information about each company, including news, earnings coverage and other financials, charts, estimates and price ratios.A company’s gross margin is its sales, less the cost of goods or services sold, divided by sales. It doesn’t incorporate overhead expenses but is useful when considering the quality of a company’s core business. If sales growth comes as a result of a significant lowering of prices in the face of competition, the trend is not sustainable. It’s a good sign if a company’s sales are growing rapidly while its gross margin is widening.FactSet doesn’t provide gross margin numbers for banks and insurance companies, which use other measures of profitability for their products and services. So here are the six S&P 500 financial-services companies that showed increases in sales per share of 25% or more for the second quarter:Don’t miss: Growth or value stocks?
