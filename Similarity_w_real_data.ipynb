       "      <th>Heres a big question Id be asking if I owned Tesla stock What happened to 345000 reservationsWhen Teslas Model 3 was released it was supposed to be a 35000 car Four hundred thousand people including yours truly put down a 1000 deposit to reserve their spots in line so they could get their hands on that marvel as soon as it became available It was a brilliant move by Tesla TSLA 275   as it provided the company 400 million of interestfree financing  the biggest crowdfunding project everToday after some delays the Model 3 is being produced However 35000 seems to have been a fiction of CEO Elon Musks imagination Though the car is getting great reviews from auto critics the price for a barebones Model 3 starts at 49000 and the tax incentives are fading awayBut something interesting happened recently I received an email from Tesla that said Model 3 is available to order and no reservation is required in the US Were now offering all our best options  including our Long Range and Performance configurations with dual motor allwheel drive You can design and order yours today for delivery in approximately 24 monthsOn the surface this sounds like great news except that it begs a question What happened to 345000 orders Let me explain According to Bloomberg which has been tracking Teslas production to date as of July 28 2018 Tesla has produced 55000 Model 3 cars Since a 1000 deposit was supposed to secure buyers a place in line any car ordered today will only be delivered after orders that were placed years ago are fulfilled  after all 400000 people paid Tesla 1000 to hold their placesThus there are only three possible explanations for the email I received One is that Model 3 production is expected to accelerate at an exponential rate to 40000 cars a week starting now However Bloomberg estimates that Teslas normal production cadence of the Model 3 is closer to 2825 cars a week so this is a highly unlikely scenarioOr two maybe Tesla has been extremely liberal with its statement of a twotofour month delivery schedule because it still has 345000 cars to produce before it can start fulfilling new orders and the company is using that email to raise additional funds from new customers making deposits The required deposit is now 2500There is a third explanation The bulk of the original 400000 orders were for a 35000 car When it came time to actually buy the car consumers may have realized that the outofpocket expense was much more than expected and simply canceled their orders draining Telsas balance sheet of 345 millionThis brings us to the next question How sound is Teslas balance sheetWhat Musk has achieved with Tesla and SpaceX is truly astounding I have incredible respect for him but he is also a magician playing a confidence game If Musk can continue to convince the market that Tesla has a bright future then the market will continue to finance Teslas losses and maybe Musk will figure out how to produce the Model 3 more cheaply and then Tesla will sell hundreds of thousands of Model 3s and the future will be as bright as Musk paints itFor that to happen Tesla needs to maintain its high stock price and investors have to believe that Musk is the Iron Man Investors have to suspend belief ignore current problems and focus on the future However if the market loses confidence in Tesla and Musk Tesla is done This company is losing billions of dollars a year it has an overlevered balance sheet This is where Musks confidence game comes inIf you believe in magic stop reading right now Okay youve been warnedThere is no magic Magic is just the art of misdirection The magician gets you to focus on the shiny object he holds in his left hand and you dont see what he is doing with his right handMusk has been showing us a lot of shiny objects Some are real like the success of SpaceX some are superfluous like sending a Tesla Roadster into space and some are future promises on which Musk may or may not be able to deliver like his futuristic underground railroad for cars the hyperloop and the Tesla truck which is unlikely to be produced on time and at the promised price The list is long in this category and neverending Musks futuristic thinking knows no boundsBut importantly these promises are the shiny objects that keep Teslas stock price highIf I was a Tesla investor Id be seriously worried about the companys balance sheet There are some ominous signs that Teslas financial situation is deteriorating rapidly Tesla reportedly recently sent an email to its suppliers asking them to give some money back to help the company with its profitabilitySuch requests are made by companies looking for Hail Mary solutions to significant financial problems If suppliers start questioning Teslas financial viability theyll start shortening their accounts receivables periods and start requesting letters of credit This would escalate the companys problems Hail Marys are acts of desperation Putting this in the context of the likely Model 3 cancellations  Teslas cash burn has likely gotten a lot worseRead Tesla says it did not ask suppliers for cash backThis brings us to the last question How effective is Musk at running TeslaTesla is Elon Musk He has achieved more than many of us will achieve in a thousand lifetimes But today Musk is running half a dozen companies Tesla SpaceX Solar City Boring OpenAI Hyperloop To make matters worse he is also an incredible micromanager I read that he interviews or at least used to every new employee who joins Tesla and SpaceXIt is clear that Musk is quite exhausted and his behavior is becoming more erratic In a conference call snafu in April he called the British diver who saved the Thai cave kids a pedo on Twitter This sort of thing undermines Musks Iron Man image  if he loses that the confidence game is lost and Tesla is doneRead UBS Goldman see Tesla shares falling 30 keep bearish stance on stock ahead of company resultsAnother red flag went up recently Musk started to attack short sellers A short seller who went under the name of Montana Sceptic posted negative research on Tesla on Twitter and SeekingAlpha Elon Musk personally called the mans employer and threatened a lawsuit if the employer didnt silence Montana Sceptic Historically companies that have gone after short sellers have had something to hide or were playing a confidence game The short sellers were interfering with the misdirection to shiny objectsRead Tesla earnings Gear up for more drama after Model 3 production burstTesla investors are still fascinated by the shiny objects but I note that CDS insurance on Teslas bonds prices in a 24 risk of default by 2025 I am not long or short the stock But if I were long Teslas shares Id be asking myself these questions After all youre paying 50 billion for a company that trades completely on the spoils of future dreamsSo how does one invest in this overvalued

       "      <th>For years one of the most successful trades in the US stock market has been to favor highgrowth stocks over ones considered to be undervalued At long last this trend may be unravelingValuebased strategies could be poised for a comeback as the overall economic environment becomes more challenging with rising interest rates and a lesscertain growth outlook At the same time the advance in growthbased plays is seen as overdone as highlighted by recent implosions in some of the strategys biggest outperformers including Facebook and NetflixWe think the turn is in wrote Morgan Stanley in a Monday note to clients saying that the almost unprecedented degree of outperformance by growth over value was poised to shiftDont miss Prepare for the biggest stockmarket selloff in months Morgan Stanley warnsThus far this year the SP 500 Growth index SP500G 068  is up 108 a move that is more than twice the 48 gain of the overall SP 500 SPX 049 Meanwhile the SP 500 Value index SP500V 027 is down 02 thus far this yearThis trend has held across market capitalization sizes The Russell 1000 Value index RLV 036  is up 04 thus far in 2018 below the overall Russell 1000 RUI 053 up 47 and the Russell 1000 Growth index RLG 070  up 88 The Russell 2000 index RUT 107  of smallcapitalization shares is up 77the Russell 2000 Growth index RUO 139  is up 97 while its value index RUJ 075  is up 54This is hardly new to 2018 Value has been such an underperformer for yearsnot only relative to growth but also to the broader marketthat last year Goldman Sachs asked whether markets had seen the death of value The investment bank was just one in a chorus of voices sounding the alarm Jeremy Grantham the founder of asset manager GMO suggested that many of the mostly widely used metrics in evaluating undervalued companies no longer held much weight for stock movesThe following FactSet chart looks at the 10year performance of the SP 500 growth index in green and compares it with both the unadjusted index red and the value index blue The chart illustrates that growth has consistently and significantly outperformed over the past decadeWe appreciate the fact that fighting momentum can be a losing game but when things get this extreme and there is evidence of a turn we have to go the other way Morgan Stanley wroteWhile growth has done better for years the degree to which it has been outperforming value has been unusually high of late According to the investment bank the difference hasnt been this extreme since the dotcom eraFurthermore the valuation difference between the largecap growth stocks and their value equivalents is also at its most extreme since 2006 According to FactSet the Russell 1000 growth index has a pricetoearnings ratio of 2921 compared with the 1798 ratio of the value indexWhile growth overall has benefited from an environment with low interest rates and steady economic expansion since the financial crisis it has particularly benefited as some of the markets biggest names have been growth plays In particular the FAANG group of stocks which refers to Facebook FB 089 Amazoncom AMZN 010 Apple AAPL 020 Netflix NFLX 074 and Googleparent Alphabet GOOGL 023GOOG 020 are all highgrowth stocksRelated Why investors shouldnt sweat the stock markets reliance on FAANG sharesWhile that group has led the market for years including in 2018 the rally has recently shown signs of cracks Both Netflix and Facebook tumbled after their most recent quarterly report with Facebook suffering its biggest oneday drop ever and dropping into bearmarket territoryFacebooks plummet resulted in a rare week of pronounced outperformance by value instead of growth last week The SP 500 value index gained 144 over last week compared with the 06 rise of the index overall The growth index dropped 01 That represented the biggest weekly outperformance by value over growth since December according to the WSJ Market Data GroupWhether this is a blip or the start of something new where investors rotate into value in an earnest way remains to be seen said Michael Mullaney director of global markets research at Boston Partners However the current environment feels a bit like the dotcom era which was the last time that tech valuations in particular got a little stretched When those pulled back that led to a period of value outperformance that lasted for yearsMorgan Stanley espoused this view saying that the outperformance of growth strategies wasnt justified by past and forecast earnings growthBased on this spread widening over the past year we think it time for a reversal Either largecap value stocks will go up more or largecap growth stocks will simply come down and catch up with the rest of the market on PE compression it wrote We think it will be the latter but would not care if it is the former Either way Value outperforms Growth and we think the spread can narrow by 1015 over the next several monthsMorgan Stanley analysts referred to the outperformance by the value contingent last week as a good startRyan Vlastelica is a markets reporter for MarketWatch and is based in New York Follow

       "      <th>Someday well look back on this summer as a turning point in the world of entertainment and how to invest in the sectorThats because this weekend marks the first time a live esports videogame competition makes it to a major networks primetime slotThe championship playoffs this Friday and Saturday of a professional esports franchise called the Overwatch League is being aired by ESPN part of Walt Disney DIS 083 from the soldout 2000seatBarclays Center in Brooklyn ESPN on Friday and ESPN3 on Saturday with a later reairing on Saturday on ESPN2 Highlights will run July 29 on Disneys ABC networkIf you dont follow the Overwatch League and other parts of the online videogame world its time to start paying attention because this popular entertainment trend offers some compelling investment opportunities Ill get to specific stock plays in a followup column Here are some basics to get you up to speedOnline videogames of course have been popular for years Fans regularly tune in to platforms like Amazons AMZN 010 Twitch and Alphabets GOOG 020GOOGL 023 YouTube Gaming to watch games and replays Twitch has viewership numbers that dwarf the combined viewership of HBO Netflix NFLX 074  and ESPNDuring the past two years videogame publishers have finally wised up on how to make more money from this trend Theyve formed competitive leagues modeled after the major sports leagues complete with team owners paid players and ties to big citiesHere are the two big ones launched in the past 18 months Riot Games a Los Angelesbased division of Chinas Tencent Holdings TCEHY 0650700 028 founded the League of Legends Championship Series Its based on the popular League of Legends game from Riot Blizzard Entertainment a division of ActivisionBlizzard ATVI 092 launched the Overwatch League a professional esports franchise based on its hugely popular game OverwatchThese leagues already drew big crowds on Twitch and platforms in Asia like Douyu and HuyaHUYA 049   But the July 2728 ESPN primetime broadcast of the Overwatch League finals is an important step in establishing esports as part of mainstream popular media says Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak The broadcast is part of a multiyear agreement between ESPN and Blizzard Entertainment for live television coverage of the Overwatch LeagueWhat exactly is esports NewZoo a research group sums up the difference from regular online videogame play in that there is an organized league a tournament with a specific goal like winning a champion title and paid professional athletesAnd yes this really is a sport Sort of It might not require the physical prowess needed to play pro basketball But esports teams train for up to eight hours a day They have coaches and nutritionists on staff And they get a regular salary About 50 colleges have varsity esports teams and esports may be part of the 2024 OlympicsThe key here is that the two leagues set up the infrastructure needed to make money from esports events even if the initial money from broadcasting deals is small Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher Merwin puts ESPN payments to ActivisionBlizzard at 10 million to 20 million a year Thats less than the estimated 45 million a year that ActivisionBlizzard gets from a twoyear distribution deal with Twitch But in investing its the medium term that matters and the potential is bigRead Meg Whitman invests in esports company ImmortalsThe League of Legends world finals last year attracted 58 million viewers according to Riot Games which publishes this game Thats already a lot bigger than the World Series 38 million the NBA finals 32 million and the Stanley Cup finals 11 million notes Goldmans MerwinBut this is just the beginning Drawing on research from NewZoo Merwin thinks the global monthly audience for esports will reach 167 million this year larger than the draw of Major League Baseball and the National Hockey LeagueBy 2022 we estimate the esports audience will reach 276 million similar in size to the NFL today he saysThere is plenty of room for growth in part because esports is going mainstream But theres also a lot of room for growth from the inside since only 15 of gamers say they have watched an esports competition says Mintel a consumer research groupAdvertisers love esports because it gives them access to younger people who are notorious cordcutters with cable television About 80 of the esports audience is under 35TMobile US TMUS 030 has partnered with the Overwatch League and teams to create branded content and offer discounts PepsiCo PEP 072  and Turtle Wax have sponsored esports teams Videogame publishers also make money by selling media rightsMerwin thinks esports revenue will hit 3 billion by 2022 from 655 million last year This will be a big deal for videogame publishers Merwin thinks esports will contribute 38 cents a share in annual earnings at Activision by 2023 For context the company averaged 98 cents a share in annual earnings during the past five years And that 38 cents a share could translate to almost 9 on the share price assuming a priceearnings multiple of 23 Activision recently traded for about 78What will continue to drive all of this growth Mainstreaming thanks to ESPN will be a big factor in attracting a fresh wave of interest in videogames Here are four others factorsJeff Reeves 7 stocks that will get you into the esports phenomenonHighly popular videogames like Fortnite which has more than 125 million players in part because anyone can play for free will continue to draw new faces into the space This will support esports growth Other popular titles attracting newcomers include PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds Dungeon Fighter Online Call of Duty Grand Theft Auto and Fédération Internationale de Football Association FIFA gamesRead How Fortnite cracked the code to become the most successful free videogame everFortnite publisher Epic Games recently offered 100 million in prize money for Fortnite esports tournaments Thats nearly the size of the entire esports prize pool in 2017 This will attract more fansAlso Want to make money off the Fortnite video game Buy this stockCompetitive gaming on mobile  as oppose to PCs  is big in Asia Analysts question whether esports and videogame play will make the same crossover in the West But Asia often sets the trends in video gaming so it mightWherever there are sports you will find gamblers And esports will be no exception International Data Corporation estimates that at least 250 million will be wagered legally on esports events this year Thats small But two factors suggest decent growth  and spillover effects  aheadOne is that Las Vegas is trying to move into this area partly as a way to attract millennials to gaming says GAMCO Investors gaming analyst Adam Trivison Luxor Hotel  Casino has set up an esports arena that Trivison describes as impressiveThe other is the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 This clears the way for states to set up sports gambling venues  including venues dedicated to esportsSports gambling is a lowmargin business says Trivison Its more of a way for casinos to draw crowdsIt will do the same thing for esportsNow read Esports are here to stay but who is poised to make a killingMichael Brush is a Manhattanbased financial writer At the time

       "      <th>In a quarter when iPhone unit sales were of somewhat diminished importance Apple Inc beat earnings and revenue expectations and then delivered an upbeat view of whats to come sending shares toward record highsThe company reported betterthanexpected results for its fiscal third quarter Tuesday posting earnings per share of 234 on revenue of 533 billion Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been projecting 216 in EPS and 523 billion in revenue Apple stock rose about 4 in afterhours trading to prices that would be record highs were they to occur during a regular trading sessionFor more on Apple earnings see our live blog recapThough Apple AAPL 020  once again fell short of Wall Streets estimates for iPhone unit sales the company more than made up for that thanks to selling more of its premium iPhones Apple ended up with an iPhone average selling price of 724 in the June quarter which was far ahead of the 693 analysts were projecting The spring quarter typically brings the lowest average selling prices of the year as Apple nears the release of new iPhones but Apple saw a meaningful increase from the 606 it reported in the prior June quarterOpinion Apple earnings show why you can expect more 1000 iPhonesArguably the most useful number in Apples fiscal thirdquarter report was its Septemberquarter outlook of 60 billion to 62 billion in revenue which came in above the FactSet consensus for 595 billion in revenue Typically investors look to Apples September forecast for indications of whether the company expects to start selling new iPhones before that quarter ends Given Apples revenue outperformance versus the consensus in the current quarter though Apples optimism could also be due to product mixServices revenue has become an increasingly important element of Apples business as it indicates how well the company is able to monetize its installed base of users amid what Chief Executive Tim Cook admitted was a lengthening upgrade cycle Apple reported 95 billion in services revenue for the latest period up from 73 billion in the yearearlier quarter Analysts had been projecting 92 billionSee also Heres what could happen to Apples average selling prices in the next iPhone cycleOn the companys earnings call Cook shared more information about the services business and he was prompted by one analyst to discuss Apples various streaming efforts He talked about how Apples services segment was getting a boost from increased usage of thirdparty subscriptionvideo products within the Apple ecosystem Apple gets a cut of the subscription fee when consumers sign up for streaming services like Netflix Inc NFLX 074   and Cook suggested Apple is seeing growth in videostreaming subscription services at about 100 on a yearoveryear basisAs for Apples own video content Cook said there was no match for Oprah Winfreys ability to connect with audiences  Apple has struck a deal with her He also said that two Sony veterans brought on last year were working on another exciting but secret project which could be a rumored streaming serviceDont miss Heres how much Apple could make from streamingApple Music its streamingmusic service now has upward of 50 million users who either pay for the service or are using a free trial and Cook said hes been told that the company took the leadership position in North America this quarter He dismissed competitive concerns saying that the endgame for Apple and rival streamingmusic companies such as Spotify Technology SA SPOT 342  and Pandora Media Inc P 246  is to expand the category not go up against each otherStreaming music is part of Apples services segment which has become an increasingly important element of Apples business The company reported 95 billion in services revenue for the latest period up from 73 billion in the yearearlier quarter Analysts had been projecting 92 billionAnother closely watched area for Apple is China where the company has seen a recent rebound That trend continued in the most recent period which marked the companys fourthstraight quarter of doubledigit growth in Greater China Apple generated 96 billion in sales from Greater China up from 8 billion in the prior June quarterCook talked a good amount on the call about tariffs striking a balance between saying that certain trade relationships are in need of modernizing but also that tariffs tend to show up as a tax on the consumer As for tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as two other rounds of tariffs that affected 50 billion of Chinese goods Apple hasnt seen any of its products directly affected according to Cook The company is in the process of sharing our views with the administration regarding a fourth round of tariffs that affects goods valued at 200 billionRead As the trade war heats up Goldman says take cover in these stocksOverall Cook said hes optimistic that the US and China will be able to work out their trade

       "      <th>Judging by the ampedup energy inside Brooklyns Barclays Center for the premier Overwatch League finals esports is here to stay  and its going to be a big sustainable consumer trend that should have a place in your investment portfolioIm not an esports fan at least not yet But I went to last weekends finals as an investor to see what all the fuss is about The atmosphere was electric especially considering that fans basically watched two teams lined up behind tables on stage playing games on a big screen above themLondon Fusion played Philadelphia Fusion in a soldout 20000seat arena and London won It wasnt quite up there with a Beatles show No second British Invasion But it was close And a lot more electric than most major league sports finalsThis enthusiasm is one reason Baird analyst Colin Sebastian thinks interactive entertainment will become the biggest piece of the media and entertainment sector hitting 145 billion in annual sales by 2020 That makes it a must own area for investors he saysBut how Sebastian highlights content providers Activision Blizzard ATVI 092 Electronic Arts EA 201 and TakeTwo Interactive TTWO 008 Heres a look at these companies and six others that should be good plays on this trendVideogame publishers benefit directly because they own the esports leagues This brings in revenue via ticket sales merchandising media rights advertising and sponsorships They also benefit indirectly because esports will bring in more fans and help boost product salesHere are the four main companies in esports leagues so far Tencent HoldingsTCEHY 0650700 034  owns Riot Games whose League of Legends is one of the worlds most popular games and the basis for the League of Legends Championship Series esports league Tencent is a key esports holding because it offers exposure to the popularity of esports in China its home turf China has the largest gamer base in the world with about 442 million gamers as of 2017 and a 57 penetration rate of Chinese internet users according to the China Internet Network Information Center This year China will contribute a third of the global game industrys total revenue says NewZooTencent has a deal with Disney DIS 083  DIS for streaming and broadcast rights for League of Legends through 2023 and it is launching a competitivegaming television channel in China Activision Blizzard owns the Overwatch League the league that played that final at the Barclays Center The league has 12 teams now but it wants to expand to 28 Activision Blizzard will also create an esports league for its Call of Duty game says Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher MerwinActivision Blizzard looks attractive for other reasons It already has a popular mobile game in Candy Crush A key source of growth will be the conversion of PC and consolebased titles into mobile games Mobile is huge in China So this could give it a greater presence in China where the company hopes to expand via a partnership with NetEase NTES 062Another catalyst for the stock should be the release of Call of Duty Black Ops 4 in OctoberWe believe Activision is building a Disneystyle entertainment business for the 21st century but with higher operating margins says Jefferies analyst Timothy OSheaLike the shares of other game publishers Activision Blizzard stock can suffer bouts of weakness on fears about competition from Fortnite published by Epic Games But not to worry While undeniably the hottest game weve seen in years Fortnite is more about expanding the market than cannibalizing it says OSheaRead Want to make money off the Fortnite videogame Buy this stock TakeTwo Interactive has a partnership with the National Basketball Association to launch the NBA 2K eLeague Electronic Arts is developing leagues based on its Fédération Internationale de Football Association FIFA and Madden NFL Football games It doesnt get much credit for this yet says Merwin So it could be the sleeper hereUnderscoring the financial muscle behind esports are the big brands that have signed on as sponsors They include Toyota TM 2337203 129 HP HPQ 009 Intel INTC 086 TMobile US TMUS 030   Nissan 7201 081 Berkshire Hathaways BRKA 062BRKB 061  Geico and Axe owned by Unilever UN 019UNIA 041ULVR 021Moreover esport team buyers include traditional sports teams owners or top executives at the New England Patriots the New York Mets and Comcast Spectator which owns the Philadelphia FlyersRead this about videogame earnings Esports are here to stay but who is poised to make a killingTwitch is the most popular platform for watching esports and competitive gaming online Its a big deal Average daily viewership for January was 962000 which means it did better than two major cable TV according to Mintel For 2017 average daily viewership was 885000 for MSNBC and 783000 for CNN Celebrities are catching on to the size of the Twitch audience and making appearances In March Drake played Fortnight with the popular gamer Tyler Ninja BlevinsTwitch is one of Amazoncoms AMZN 010 bestkept secrets says Motely Fool writer John Ballard He thinks Amazons 2014 purchase of Twitch for 970 million is starting to look like a really clever move Ballard describes Twitch a social network for gamers where viewers can watch their favorite streamers chat with other gamers and develop their skillsAs the biggest platform with about 70 of monthly active users in the online gaming space according to Goldman Sachs Twitch benefits from the network effect This means it has the power to continually attract more users and become more useful to them as it does this Amazoncom makes money from Twitch by taking a cut of sales on the platform It has also integrated Twitch into Prime which helps Prime get more users Twitch represents one of the most compelling assets in the world of esports says Goldman Sachs analyst Heath TerryOddly Amazon doesnt mention Twitch in its most recent 10Q It mentions it once in its most recent 10K but only as a formality and with no descriptionElectronic Arts looks like another good platform company to own Taking a page out of the books of Netflix NFLX 074  and Spotify SPOT 342 Eletronic Arts is developing a streaming game serviceCEO Andrew Wilson is positioning the company for a future in which videogames are streamed to all devices via subscription says Jefferies analyst Timothy OShea The company will offer all its games on the service and it is working on adding thirdparty party titlesAccording to tech investing lore you do well investing in the companies that make the gear used in a tech trend and not just the companies selling the final products or services If thats true then Nvidia NVDA 030  should continue to be a good investment It makes the highend GeForce line of graphics processing units GPUs used in the highpowered PCs that gamers like So the growing popularity of esports will help NvidiaWe view Nvidia as uniquely positioned to capture growth in the PC gaming user base says Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari Nvidia has a dominant position in gamerelated chips in part because it puts most of its development budget into its GPU platform while competitor Advanced Micro Device AMD 561  invests in a number of different product lines Nvidias specialized chips are also used in artificial intelligence machinelearning data centers and selfdriving carsFor arms merchants also consider Logitech International LOGI 455  a top supplier of highend gaming mice headsets and specialized gaming keyboards And dont forget Microsoft MSFT 067 It never did well with smartphones But consoles are another matter Microsoft sells the popular Xbox Late last year it refreshed the line by rolling out the Xbox One X with hardcore gamers in mindFor a broad based approach to the videogame and esports trends consider the 120 million videogame Tech exchangetraded fund  GAMR 013  It holds most of the major players in this space but be warned it has 72 stocks the largest is Glu Mobile  GLUU 250   so it is not a pure pay on the names Ive highlighted above It also has a steep expense ratio of 082 Not only is that a lot higher than the category average of 055 as calculated by Morningstar but its way more than the 009 expense ratio levied for the SPDR SP 500  SPY 049  which tracks the SP 500 index  SPX 049The ETF is essentially flat on the year compared with the SPs 5 gainAt the time of publication Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column Brush has suggested

       "      <th>For years one of the most successful trades in the US stock market has been to favor highgrowth stocks over ones considered to be undervalued At long last this trend may be unravelingValuebased strategies could be poised for a comeback as the overall economic environment becomes more challenging with rising interest rates and a lesscertain growth outlook At the same time the advance in growthbased plays is seen as overdone as highlighted by recent implosions in some of the strategys biggest outperformers including Facebook and NetflixWe think the turn is in wrote Morgan Stanley in a Monday note to clients saying that the almost unprecedented degree of outperformance by growth over value was poised to shiftDont miss Prepare for the biggest stockmarket selloff in months Morgan Stanley warnsThus far this year the SP 500 Growth index SP500G 068  is up 108 a move that is more than twice the 48 gain of the overall SP 500 SPX 049 Meanwhile the SP 500 Value index SP500V 027 is down 02 thus far this yearThis trend has held across market capitalization sizes The Russell 1000 Value index RLV 036  is up 04 thus far in 2018 below the overall Russell 1000 RUI 053 up 47 and the Russell 1000 Growth index RLG 070  up 88 The Russell 2000 index RUT 107  of smallcapitalization shares is up 77the Russell 2000 Growth index RUO 139  is up 97 while its value index RUJ 075  is up 54This is hardly new to 2018 Value has been such an underperformer for yearsnot only relative to growth but also to the broader marketthat last year Goldman Sachs asked whether markets had seen the death of value The investment bank was just one in a chorus of voices sounding the alarm Jeremy Grantham the founder of asset manager GMO suggested that many of the mostly widely used metrics in evaluating undervalued companies no longer held much weight for stock movesThe following FactSet chart looks at the 10year performance of the SP 500 growth index in green and compares it with both the unadjusted index red and the value index blue The chart illustrates that growth has consistently and significantly outperformed over the past decadeWe appreciate the fact that fighting momentum can be a losing game but when things get this extreme and there is evidence of a turn we have to go the other way Morgan Stanley wroteWhile growth has done better for years the degree to which it has been outperforming value has been unusually high of late According to the investment bank the difference hasnt been this extreme since the dotcom eraFurthermore the valuation difference between the largecap growth stocks and their value equivalents is also at its most extreme since 2006 According to FactSet the Russell 1000 growth index has a pricetoearnings ratio of 2921 compared with the 1798 ratio of the value indexWhile growth overall has benefited from an environment with low interest rates and steady economic expansion since the financial crisis it has particularly benefited as some of the markets biggest names have been growth plays In particular the FAANG group of stocks which refers to Facebook FB 089 Amazoncom AMZN 010 Apple AAPL 020 Netflix NFLX 074 and Googleparent Alphabet GOOGL 023GOOG 020 are all highgrowth stocksRelated Why investors shouldnt sweat the stock markets reliance on FAANG sharesWhile that group has led the market for years including in 2018 the rally has recently shown signs of cracks Both Netflix and Facebook tumbled after their most recent quarterly report with Facebook suffering its biggest oneday drop ever and dropping into bearmarket territoryFacebooks plummet resulted in a rare week of pronounced outperformance by value instead of growth last week The SP 500 value index gained 144 over last week compared with the 06 rise of the index overall The growth index dropped 01 That represented the biggest weekly outperformance by value over growth since December according to the WSJ Market Data GroupWhether this is a blip or the start of something new where investors rotate into value in an earnest way remains to be seen said Michael Mullaney director of global markets research at Boston Partners However the current environment feels a bit like the dotcom era which was the last time that tech valuations in particular got a little stretched When those pulled back that led to a period of value outperformance that lasted for yearsMorgan Stanley espoused this view saying that the outperformance of growth strategies wasnt justified by past and forecast earnings growthBased on this spread widening over the past year we think it time for a reversal Either largecap value stocks will go up more or largecap growth stocks will simply come down and catch up with the rest of the market on PE compression it wrote We think it will be the latter but would not care if it is the former Either way Value outperforms Growth and we think the spread can narrow by 1015 over the next several monthsMorgan Stanley analysts referred to the outperformance by the value contingent last week as a good startRyan Vlastelica is a markets reporter for MarketWatch and is based in New York Follow

       "      <th>For years one of the most successful trades in the US stock market has been to favor highgrowth stocks over ones considered to be undervalued At long last this trend may be unravelingValuebased strategies could be poised for a comeback as the overall economic environment becomes more challenging with rising interest rates and a lesscertain growth outlook At the same time the advance in growthbased plays is seen as overdone as highlighted by recent implosions in some of the strategys biggest outperformers including Facebook and NetflixWe think the turn is in wrote Morgan Stanley in a Monday note to clients saying that the almost unprecedented degree of outperformance by growth over value was poised to shiftDont miss Prepare for the biggest stockmarket selloff in months Morgan Stanley warnsThus far this year the SP 500 Growth index SP500G 068  is up 108 a move that is more than twice the 48 gain of the overall SP 500 SPX 049 Meanwhile the SP 500 Value index SP500V 027 is down 02 thus far this yearThis trend has held across market capitalization sizes The Russell 1000 Value index RLV 036  is up 04 thus far in 2018 below the overall Russell 1000 RUI 053 up 47 and the Russell 1000 Growth index RLG 070  up 88 The Russell 2000 index RUT 107  of smallcapitalization shares is up 77the Russell 2000 Growth index RUO 139  is up 97 while its value index RUJ 075  is up 54This is hardly new to 2018 Value has been such an underperformer for yearsnot only relative to growth but also to the broader marketthat last year Goldman Sachs asked whether markets had seen the death of value The investment bank was just one in a chorus of voices sounding the alarm Jeremy Grantham the founder of asset manager GMO suggested that many of the mostly widely used metrics in evaluating undervalued companies no longer held much weight for stock movesThe following FactSet chart looks at the 10year performance of the SP 500 growth index in green and compares it with both the unadjusted index red and the value index blue The chart illustrates that growth has consistently and significantly outperformed over the past decadeWe appreciate the fact that fighting momentum can be a losing game but when things get this extreme and there is evidence of a turn we have to go the other way Morgan Stanley wroteWhile growth has done better for years the degree to which it has been outperforming value has been unusually high of late According to the investment bank the difference hasnt been this extreme since the dotcom eraFurthermore the valuation difference between the largecap growth stocks and their value equivalents is also at its most extreme since 2006 According to FactSet the Russell 1000 growth index has a pricetoearnings ratio of 2921 compared with the 1798 ratio of the value indexWhile growth overall has benefited from an environment with low interest rates and steady economic expansion since the financial crisis it has particularly benefited as some of the markets biggest names have been growth plays In particular the FAANG group of stocks which refers to Facebook FB 089 Amazoncom AMZN 010 Apple AAPL 020 Netflix NFLX 074 and Googleparent Alphabet GOOGL 023GOOG 020 are all highgrowth stocksRelated Why investors shouldnt sweat the stock markets reliance on FAANG sharesWhile that group has led the market for years including in 2018 the rally has recently shown signs of cracks Both Netflix and Facebook tumbled after their most recent quarterly report with Facebook suffering its biggest oneday drop ever and dropping into bearmarket territoryFacebooks plummet resulted in a rare week of pronounced outperformance by value instead of growth last week The SP 500 value index gained 144 over last week compared with the 06 rise of the index overall The growth index dropped 01 That represented the biggest weekly outperformance by value over growth since December according to the WSJ Market Data GroupWhether this is a blip or the start of something new where investors rotate into value in an earnest way remains to be seen said Michael Mullaney director of global markets research at Boston Partners However the current environment feels a bit like the dotcom era which was the last time that tech valuations in particular got a little stretched When those pulled back that led to a period of value outperformance that lasted for yearsMorgan Stanley espoused this view saying that the outperformance of growth strategies wasnt justified by past and forecast earnings growthBased on this spread widening over the past year we think it time for a reversal Either largecap value stocks will go up more or largecap growth stocks will simply come down and catch up with the rest of the market on PE compression it wrote We think it will be the latter but would not care if it is the former Either way Value outperforms Growth and we think the spread can narrow by 1015 over the next several monthsMorgan Stanley analysts referred to the outperformance by the value contingent last week as a good startRyan Vlastelica is a markets reporter for MarketWatch and is based in New York Follow

trend that should have a place in your investment portfolioIm not an esports fan at least not yet But I went to last weekends finals as an investor to see what all the fuss is about The atmosphere was electric especially considering that fans basically watched two teams lined up behind tables on stage playing games on a big screen above themLondon Fusion played Philadelphia Fusion in a soldout 20000seat arena and London won It wasnt quite up there with a Beatles show No second British Invasion But it was close And a lot more electric than most major league sports finalsThis enthusiasm is one reason Baird analyst Colin Sebastian thinks interactive entertainment will become the biggest piece of the media and entertainment sector hitting 145 billion in annual sales by 2020 That makes it a must own area for investors he saysBut how Sebastian highlights content providers Activision Blizzard ATVI 092 Electronic Arts EA 201 and TakeTwo Interactive TTWO 008 Heres a look at these companies and six others that should be good plays on this trendVideogame publishers benefit directly because they own the esports leagues This brings in revenue via ticket sales merchandising media rights advertising and sponsorships They also benefit indirectly because esports will bring in more fans and help boost product salesHere are the four main companies in esports leagues so far Tencent HoldingsTCEHY 0650700 045  owns Riot Games whose League of Legends is one of the worlds most popular games and the basis for the League of Legends Championship Series esports league Tencent is a key esports holding because it offers exposure to the popularity of esports in China its home turf China has the largest gamer base in the world with about 442 million gamers as of 2017 and a 57 penetration rate of Chinese internet users according to the China Internet Network Information Center This year China will contribute a third of the global game industrys total revenue says NewZooTencent has a deal with Disney DIS 083  DIS for streaming and broadcast rights for League of Legends through 2023 and it is launching a competitivegaming television channel in China Activision Blizzard owns the Overwatch League the league that played that final at the Barclays Center The league has 12 teams now but it wants to expand to 28 Activision Blizzard will also create an esports league for its Call of Duty game says Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher MerwinActivision Blizzard looks attractive for other reasons It already has a popular mobile game in Candy Crush A key source of growth will be the conversion of PC and consolebased titles into mobile games Mobile is huge in China So this could give it a greater presence in China where the company hopes to expand via a partnership with NetEase NTES 062Another catalyst for the stock should be the release of Call of Duty Black Ops 4 in OctoberWe believe Activision is building a Disneystyle entertainment business for the 21st century but with higher operating margins says Jefferies analyst Timothy OSheaLike the shares of other game publishers Activision Blizzard stock can suffer bouts of weakness on fears about competition from Fortnite published by Epic Games But not to worry While undeniably the hottest game weve seen in years Fortnite is more about expanding the market than cannibalizing it says OSheaRead Want to make money off the Fortnite videogame Buy this stock TakeTwo Interactive has a partnership with the National Basketball Association to launch the NBA 2K eLeague Electronic Arts is developing leagues based on its Fédération Internationale de Football Association FIFA and Madden NFL Football games It doesnt get much credit for this yet says Merwin So it could be the sleeper hereUnderscoring the financial muscle behind esports are the big brands that have signed on as sponsors They include Toyota TM 2337203 129 HP HPQ 009 Intel INTC 086 TMobile US TMUS 030   Nissan 7201

most popular platform for watching esports and competitive gaming online Its a big deal Average daily viewership for January was 962000 which means it did better than two major cable TV according to

starting to look like a really clever move Ballard describes Twitch a social network for gamers where viewers can watch their favorite streamers chat with other gamers and develop their skillsAs the biggest platform with about 70 of monthly active users in the online gaming space according to Goldman Sachs Twitch benefits from the network effect This means it has the power to continually attract more users and become more useful to them as it does this Amazoncom makes money from Twitch by taking a cut of sales on the platform It has also integrated Twitch into Prime which helps Prime get more users Twitch represents one of the most compelling assets in the world of esports says Goldman Sachs analyst Heath TerryOddly Amazon doesnt mention Twitch in its most recent 10Q It mentions it once in its most recent 10K but only as a formality and with no descriptionElectronic Arts looks like another good platform company to own Taking a page out of the books of Netflix NFLX 074  and Spotify SPOT 342 Eletronic Arts is developing a streaming game serviceCEO Andrew Wilson is positioning the company for a future in which videogames are streamed to all devices via subscription says Jefferies analyst Timothy OShea The company will offer all its games on the service and it is working on adding thirdparty party titlesAccording to tech investing lore you do well investing in the companies that make the gear used in a tech trend and not just the companies selling the final products or services If thats true then Nvidia NVDA 030  should continue to be a good investment It makes the highend GeForce line of graphics processing units GPUs used in the highpowered PCs that gamers like So the growing popularity of esports will help NvidiaWe view Nvidia as uniquely positioned to capture growth in the PC gaming user base says Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari Nvidia has a dominant position in gamerelated chips in part because it puts most of its development budget into its GPU platform while competitor Advanced Micro Device AMD 561  invests in a number of different product lines Nvidias specialized chips are also used in artificial

commercial bookings up 18 in constantcurrency gains and Azure cloud apps growth up 85 all figures in constant currency While the commercial cloud business up 50 to 69 billion in revenue continues to garner much of the attention we believe Microsoft saw strong performance across all of its business lines with continued acceleration in LinkedIn up 34 and gaming up 38 Its commercial cloud gross margins continue to tick higher up 58 and intelligent cloud operating income jumped 30 year over yearLooking forward the company continues to see a strong backdrop for its commercial offerings and we expect another year of doubledigit topline growth and some modest operating leverage despite a big jump in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 While oneupping its performance in 2018 will be difficult the secular trends powering Microsofts various businesses remain intact and we believe it is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for enterprise cloud services We also view the

       "      <th>Sarat Sethi and Ned Dewees the two managing partners at Douglas C Lane  Associates consider themselves oldfashioned buyandhold stockpickers Between them they have 42 years at the firm which oversees 54 billion for its clients Sethi 48 and Dewees 61 dont fit neatly into one particular investing style they invest in longterm themes that can lead them almost anywhere in the market Today their big themes include a rosy view of the US economy and the US consumer and Big Data The firm runs separate accounts usually with about 60 stocks Their stock portfolios which typically dont include Amazoncom ticker AMZN or Netflix NFLX havent fared well lately The firms core equity composite had a net return of 027 for the first half trailing the SP 500 by more than two percentage points The news is better over the long run Since its inception in June 1995 the equity composite has an annual return of 102 versus 93 for the SP 500 Barrons sat down with Sethi and Dewees at their midtown Manhattan office to learn the reasons for their optimism and what that means for the stocks in their portfolioBarrons You manage a concentrated goanywhere portfolio Where do you startSethi We look for the best valuationslargecap smallcap value or growth it doesnt matter to us Our tendency is to look for stocks that are out of favor but that doesnt hold us back from buying growth stocks as well We may think a stock is undervalued based on its core intrinsic value or its growth rate even a high growth rate Stocks dont have to have a certain metric for us to buy themDewees Our largest holding is Illumina ILMN a biotech firm It used to be a midcap stock but now it is a largecap with a high multiple trading at more than 60 times this years earnings estimate Also in the top 10 is General Motors GM which is trading at six times earnings with a yield of nearly 4 We also have two smallercap stocks in our top 10  IACInterActiveCorp IAC and XPO Logistics XPO both with market caps of about 12 billionAmazon and Netflix are conspicuously absent from your portfolio which hasnt helped you relative to the marketSethi They are great companies but at these levels there are better opportunities elsewhereWhat do you like about the tech stocks you do ownSethi Weve owned Alphabet GOOGL for five years it owns mobile search globally and YouTube is also a growth engine Facebook FB is still the best platform for targeted advertising and it has massive growth rates That hasnt changed after last Thursdays 19 drop We also own Microsoft MSFT its Office 365s subscription growth combined with Azure its cloud computing service is a powerful combination We also own some value plays in tech like Oracle ORCL which we view as a turnaround as it shifts more of its business to a subscription modelYou mentioned General Motors as a top holdingit has been cheap for a long time Whats to likeSethi It seems like anytime somebody in the world sneezes GM catches a cold But they have bought back more than 20 of their shares since 2011 It is a freecashflow machine Its yield is nearly 4 and it trades at six times this years earnings estimate Im not sure what its growth is but GM has a much better growth rate than six times earningsDewees People still dont believe that GM will go through the next downturn in the auto cycle and not go down to making zero or 1 a share Our strong belief is it will be able to get through a downturn If theres a frustration with holding this stock its that weve just gone through this good period for auto sales in the past five yearsbut the stock hasnt done well in that time Its annual return is 5 versus 13 for the SP 500GM released disappointing earnings this week in which it lowered earnings guidance for this year Does that change your view of the stockSethi No This company is as cheap if not cheaper than it has ever been since its initial public offering in 2010 yet its a far stronger business Its increasingly clear to us that GM needs to demonstrate its resilience in a downturn for the company to shrug off the historical biases embedded in the companys valuationThat could take a whileDewees Were patient investorsSethi Im going to clip a 4 coupon of a stock thats trading at six times earnings GM has done its heavy lifting within its core automotive business by derisking its operations and eliminating bad businessesHow high can GMs stock goDewees Price targets are always tricky because if you invest in a good company that is going to innovate and grow why would you say Im investing in it at 30 and Ill sell it at 45 if the company is going to continue to run well Right now theres the wall of worry even as the market remains healthy and strong True there are geopolitical factors including tariff fearsalthough we are talking about a tiny piece of tariffs But the stock market will continue to think that a shoe is about to drop although the underlying health of this economy is better than it has been for a long long timeHow soSethi We think the economy remains healthy with wages rising healthy employment and strong demand Additionally corporate and consumer confidence is strong However a drawn out tradetariff war or suddenly high interest rates could be a potential headwind to the economy and investor confidenceYour portfolio has a bigger helping of financial and industrial stocks than the SP 500 Whats so appealing Lets start with financialsSethi The valuations are cheaper than the SP and the growth rate is higher One of our holdings is First Republic Bank FRC a regional bank in San Francisco with a market cap of 16 billion They do traditional lending and wealth management Their management team has a solid track record they have very focused strategies in the markets that they want to be in including the West Coast Massachusetts Florida Connecticut and New YorkThis bank is underappreciated for its highsingledigit growth rate although the stock does trade at a premium to the SP 500 Its at about 21 times this years earnings estimate of 477 a share and a little more than two times book value which is reasonableFor many banks loan growth has been a concern Is that the case with First RepublicSethi Thats another misperception of the market One thing to consider is that the tax cuts have helped companies and their cash flow And these banks are not necessarily going out to get more loans Secondly interest rates are still relatively low so a lot of individuals and corporations have termed out their debt meaning they are taking out debt over longer periods They dont necessarily have to borrow money in the short term when they can get loans over three five 10 yearsand furtheroutAnd presumably theres an impact from interest rates still being quite lowSethi Thats right Rates are still relatively low going out on the yield curve Its at the front end of the curve where rates have moved a lot higher Why get higher rates at the front end when you can actually go out over longer time periods and issue bonds at very reasonable rates A lot of companies have done that However that reduces a banks lending activity Plus a lot of banks including First Republic are being more stringent in their lendingOK And as for industrials What do you like thereDewees Maxar Technologies MAXR The company took that name last year when DigitalGlobe was acquired by a Canadian satellite company called MacDonald Dettwiler  Associates It was run by Howard Lance since May 2016 One of the first things he did was buy DigitalGlobe whose stock we owned at the time So we became an owner of the combined company which changed its name to Maxar It used to only trade in Toronto But it now trades on the New York Stock Exchange as well Howard Lance ran Harris Corp HRS a defense electronics company from 2003 to 2011 and he did a great job Hes very experienced and capable and in his early 60s we expect him to accomplish a lot more He is one of the main reasons we own Maxar The valuation is pretty low about 11 times this years consensus earnings estimate of 476 a share with a 2 dividend yieldWhats the market concerned aboutDewees People are worried about the strength of the legacy satelliteconstruction business of MacDonald Dettwiler and they are worried about a big US government contract with the National GeospatialIntelligence Agency that is coming up for renewal in 2020 Thats the old DigitalGlobe businessIts our feeling that the NGA is going to renew that contract which represents 15 of revenues today The satellite constellation used to support the NGA contract isnt exclusively for US defense purposes it is also used by USfriendly foreign governments plus there are commercial uses like figuring out where farmers should plant their crops Maxar also has a library of satellite images that can be used for all kinds of data analytics The company has a cloudbased opensource platform that hosts the imagery and allows app developers and other third parties to access the image library to build new apps and algorithms Its an assetlight business thats small but growing fast Its very valuableWhat about the satelliteconstruction businessDewees It has been lumpy Theyll have a big year followed by one thats not as strong Remember though that the large satelliteconstruction business represents less than 10 of the companys earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization Maxar recently reported earnings that came in below the consensus they had a soft quarter Investors have extrapolated that to Maxars long termgrowth rate We think it was more of a blip Another concern is that it will take a few years to pay down debt they took on for the DigitalGlobe deal but its manageable Our view is that the stock is worth 100 a share compared with 52 and change recentlyThanks Ned and Sarat </th>\n",

sending shares toward record highsThe company reported betterthanexpected results for its fiscal third quarter Tuesday posting earnings per share of 234 on revenue of 533 billion Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been projecting 216 in EPS and 523 billion in revenue Apple stock rose about 4 in afterhours trading to prices that would be record highs were they to occur during a regular trading sessionFor more on Apple earnings see our live blog recapThough Apple AAPL 020 \\xa0once again fell short of Wall Street\\x92s estimates for iPhone unit sales the company more than made up for that thanks to selling more of its premium iPhones Apple ended up with an iPhone average selling price of 724 in the June quarter which was far ahead of the 693 analysts were projecting The spring quarter typically brings the lowest average selling prices of the year as Apple nears the release of new iPhones but Apple saw a meaningful increase from the 606 it reported in the prior June quarterOpinion Apple earnings show why you can expect more 1000 iPhonesArguably the most useful number in Apple\\x92s fiscal thirdquarter report was its Septemberquarter outlook of 60 billion to 62 billion in revenue which came in above the FactSet consensus for 595 billion in revenue Typically investors look to Apple\\x92s September forecast for indications of whether the company expects to start selling new iPhones before that quarter ends Given Apple\\x92s revenue outperformance versus the consensus in the current quarter though Apple\\x92s optimism could also be due to product mixServices revenue has become an increasingly important element of Apple\\x92s business as it indicates how well the company is able to monetize its installed base of users amid what Chief Executive Tim Cook admitted was a lengthening upgrade cycle Apple reported 95 billion in services revenue for the latest period up from 73 billion in the yearearlier quarter Analysts had been projecting 92 billionSee also Here\\x92s what could happen to Apple\\x92s average selling prices in the next iPhone cycleOn the company\\x92s earnings call Cook shared more information about the services business and he was prompted by one analyst to discuss Apple\\x92s various streaming efforts He talked about how Apple\\x92s services segment was getting a boost from increased usage of thirdparty subscriptionvideo products within the Apple ecosystem Apple gets a cut of the subscription fee when consumers sign up for streaming services like Netflix Inc NFLX 074 \\xa0 and Cook suggested Apple is seeing growth in videostreaming subscription services at about 100 on a yearoveryear basisAs for Apple\\x92s own video content Cook said there was \\x93no match\\x94 for Oprah Winfrey\\x92s ability to connect with audiences \\x97 Apple has struck a deal with her He also said that two Sony veterans brought on last year were working on another exciting but secret project which could be a rumored streaming serviceDon\\x92t miss Here\\x92s how much Apple could make from streamingApple Music its streamingmusic service now has upward of 50 million users who either pay for the service or are using a free trial and Cook said he\\x92s \\x93been told\\x94 that the company \\x93took the leadership position in North America\\x94 this quarter He dismissed competitive concerns saying that the endgame for Apple and rival streamingmusic companies such as Spotify Technology SA SPOT 342 \\xa0and Pandora Media Inc P 246 \\xa0is to expand the category not go up against each otherStreaming music is part of Apple\\x92s services segment which has become an increasingly important element of Apple\\x92s business The company reported 95 billion in services revenue for the latest period up from 73 billion in the yearearlier quarter Analysts had been projecting 92 billionAnother closely watched area for Apple is China where the company has seen a recent rebound That trend continued in the most recent period which marked the company\\x92s fourthstraight quarter of doubledigit growth in Greater China Apple generated 96 billion in sales from Greater China up from 8 billion in the prior June quarterCook talked a good amount on the call about tariffs striking a balance between saying that certain trade relationships \\x93are in need of modernizing\\x94 but also that tariffs tend to show up \\x93as a tax on the consumer\\x94 As for tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as two other rounds of tariffs that affected 50 billion of Chinese goods Apple hasn\\x92t seen any of its products directly affected according to Cook The company is in the process of \\x93sharing our views with the administration\\x94 regarding a fourth round of tariffs that affects goods valued at 200

       "       'Judging by the ampedup energy inside Brooklyn\\x92s Barclays Center for the premier Overwatch League finals esports is here to stay \\x97 and it\\x92s going to be a big sustainable consumer trend that should have a place in your investment portfolioI\\x92m not an esports fan at least not yet But I went to last weekend\\x92s finals as an investor to see what all the fuss is about The atmosphere was electric especially considering that fans basically watched two teams lined up behind tables on stage playing games on a big screen above themLondon Fusion played Philadelphia Fusion in a soldout 20000seat arena and London won It wasn\\x92t quite up there with a Beatles show No second British Invasion But it was close And a lot more electric than most major league sports finalsThis enthusiasm is one reason Baird analyst Colin Sebastian thinks interactive entertainment will become the biggest piece of the media and entertainment sector hitting 145 billion in annual sales by 2020 That makes it a \\x93must own\\x94 area for investors he saysBut how Sebastian highlights content providers Activision Blizzard ATVI 092 Electronic Arts EA 201 and TakeTwo Interactive TTWO 008 Here\\x92s a look at these companies and six others that should be good plays on this trendVideogame publishers benefit directly because they own the esports leagues This brings in revenue via ticket sales merchandising media rights advertising and sponsorships They also benefit indirectly because esports will bring in more fans and help boost product salesHere are the four main companies in esports leagues so far\\x95 Tencent HoldingsTCEHY 0650700 034 \\xa0owns Riot Games whose League of Legends is one of the world\\x92s most popular games and the basis for the League of Legends Championship Series esports league Tencent is a key esports holding because it offers exposure to the popularity of esports in China its home turf China has the largest gamer base in the world with about 442 million gamers as of 2017 and a 57 penetration rate of Chinese internet users according to the China Internet Network Information Center This year China will contribute a third of the global game industry\\x92s total revenue says NewZooTencent has a deal with Disney DIS 083 \\xa0DIS for streaming and broadcast rights for League of Legends through 2023 and it is launching a competitivegaming television channel in China\\x95 Activision Blizzard owns the Overwatch League the league that played that final at the Barclays Center The league has 12 teams now but it wants to expand to 28 Activision Blizzard will also create an esports league for its Call of Duty game says Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher MerwinActivision Blizzard looks attractive for other reasons It already has a popular mobile game in Candy Crush A key source of growth will be the conversion of PC and consolebased titles into mobile games Mobile is huge in China So this could give it a greater presence in China where the company hopes to expand via a partnership with NetEase NTES 062Another catalyst for the stock should be the release of \\x93Call of Duty Black Ops 4\\x94 in October\\x93We believe Activision is building a Disneystyle entertainment business for the 21st century but with higher operating margins\\x94 says Jefferies analyst Timothy O\\x92SheaLike the shares of other game publishers Activision Blizzard stock can suffer bouts of weakness on fears about competition from Fortnite published by Epic Games But not to worry \\x93While undeniably the hottest game we\\x92ve seen in years Fortnite is more about expanding the market than cannibalizing it\\x94 says O\\x92SheaRead Want to make money off the \\x91Fortnite\\x92 videogame Buy this stock\\x95 TakeTwo Interactive has a partnership with the National Basketball Association to launch the NBA 2K eLeague\\x95 Electronic Arts is developing leagues based on its Fédération Internationale de Football Association FIFA and Madden NFL Football games It doesn\\x92t get much credit for this yet says Merwin So it could be the sleeper hereUnderscoring the financial muscle behind esports are the big brands that have signed on as sponsors They include Toyota TM 2337203 129 HP HPQ 009 Intel INTC 086 TMobile US TMUS 030 \\xa0 Nissan 7201 081 Berkshire Hathaway\\x92s BRKA 062BRKB 061 \\xa0Geico and Axe owned by Unilever UN 019UNIA 041ULVR 021Moreover esport team buyers include traditional sports teams owners or top executives at the New England Patriots the New York Mets and Comcast Spectator which owns the Philadelphia FlyersRead this about videogame earnings Esports are here to stay but who is poised to make a killingTwitch is the most popular platform for watching esports and competitive gaming online It\\x92s a big deal Average daily viewership for January was 962000 which means it did better than two major cable TV according to Mintel For 2017 average daily viewership was 885000 for MSNBC and 783000 for CNN Celebrities are catching on to the size of the Twitch audience and making appearances In March Drake played Fortnight with the popular gamer Tyler \\x93Ninja\\x94 BlevinsTwitch is one of Amazoncom\\x92s AMZN 010 bestkept secrets says Motely Fool writer John Ballard He thinks Amazon\\x92s 2014 purchase of Twitch for 970 million is starting to look like a really clever move Ballard describes Twitch a social network for gamers where viewers can watch their favorite streamers chat with other gamers and develop their skillsAs the biggest platform with about 70 of monthly active users in the online gaming space according to Goldman Sachs Twitch benefits from the \\x93network effect\\x94 This means it has the power to continually attract more users and become more useful to them as it does this Amazoncom makes money from Twitch by taking a cut of sales on the platform It has also integrated Twitch into Prime which helps Prime get more users \\x93Twitch represents one of the most compelling assets in the world of esports\\x94 says Goldman Sachs analyst Heath TerryOddly Amazon doesn\\x92t mention Twitch in its most recent 10Q It mentions it once in its most recent 10K but only as a formality and with no descriptionElectronic Arts looks like another good platform company to own Taking a page out of the books of Netflix NFLX 074 \\xa0and Spotify SPOT 342 Eletronic Arts is developing a streaming game service\\x93CEO Andrew Wilson is positioning the company for a future in which videogames are streamed to all devices via subscription\\x94 says Jefferies analyst Timothy O\\x92Shea The company will offer all its games on the service and it is working on adding thirdparty party titlesAccording to tech investing lore you do well investing in the companies that make the gear used in a tech trend and not just the companies selling the final products or services If that\\x92s true then Nvidia NVDA 030 \\xa0should continue to be a good investment It makes the

       "       'Judging by the ampedup energy inside Brooklyn\\x92s Barclays Center for the premier Overwatch League finals esports is here to stay \\x97 and it\\x92s going to be a big sustainable consumer trend that should have a place in your investment portfolioI\\x92m not an esports fan at least not yet But I went to last weekend\\x92s finals as an investor to see what all the fuss is about The atmosphere was electric especially considering that fans basically watched two teams lined up behind tables on stage playing games on a big screen above themLondon Fusion played Philadelphia Fusion in a soldout 20000seat arena and London won It wasn\\x92t quite up there with a Beatles show No second British Invasion But it was close And a lot more electric than most major league sports finalsThis enthusiasm is one reason Baird analyst Colin Sebastian thinks interactive entertainment will become the biggest piece of the media and entertainment sector hitting 145 billion in annual sales by 2020 That makes it a \\x93must own\\x94 area for investors he saysBut how Sebastian highlights content providers Activision Blizzard ATVI 092 Electronic Arts EA 201 and TakeTwo Interactive TTWO 008 Here\\x92s a look at these companies and six others that should be good plays on this trendVideogame publishers benefit directly because they own the esports leagues This brings in revenue via ticket sales merchandising media rights advertising and sponsorships They also benefit indirectly because esports will bring in more fans and help boost product salesHere are the four main companies in esports leagues so far\\x95 Tencent HoldingsTCEHY 0650700 045 \\xa0owns Riot Games whose League of Legends is one of the world\\x92s most popular games and the basis for the League of Legends Championship Series esports league Tencent is a key esports holding because it offers exposure to the popularity of esports in China its home turf China has the largest gamer base in the world with about 442 million gamers as of 2017 and a 57 penetration rate of Chinese internet users according to the China Internet Network Information Center This year China will contribute a third of the global game industry\\x92s total revenue says NewZooTencent has a deal with Disney DIS 083 \\xa0DIS for streaming and broadcast rights for League of Legends through 2023 and it is launching a competitivegaming television channel in China\\x95 Activision Blizzard owns the Overwatch League the league that played that final at the Barclays Center The league has 12 teams now but it wants to expand to 28 Activision Blizzard will also create an esports league for its Call of Duty game says Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher MerwinActivision Blizzard looks attractive for other reasons It already has a popular mobile game in Candy Crush A key source of growth will be the conversion of PC and consolebased titles into mobile games Mobile is huge in China So this could give it a greater presence in China where the company hopes to expand via a partnership with NetEase NTES 062Another catalyst for the stock should be the release of \\x93Call of Duty Black Ops 4\\x94 in October\\x93We believe Activision is building a Disneystyle entertainment business for the 21st century but with higher operating margins\\x94 says Jefferies analyst Timothy O\\x92SheaLike the shares of other game publishers Activision Blizzard stock can suffer bouts of weakness on fears about competition from Fortnite published by Epic Games But not to worry \\x93While undeniably the hottest game we\\x92ve seen in years Fortnite is more about expanding the market than cannibalizing it\\x94 says O\\x92SheaRead Want to make money off the \\x91Fortnite\\x92 videogame Buy this stock\\x95 TakeTwo Interactive has a partnership with the National Basketball Association to launch the NBA 2K eLeague\\x95 Electronic Arts is developing leagues based on its Fédération Internationale de Football Association FIFA and Madden NFL Football games It doesn\\x92t get much credit for this yet says Merwin So it could be the sleeper hereUnderscoring the financial muscle behind esports are the big brands that have signed on as sponsors They include Toyota TM 2337203 129 HP HPQ 009 Intel INTC 086 TMobile US TMUS 030 \\xa0 Nissan 7201 081 Berkshire Hathaway\\x92s BRKA 062BRKB 061 \\xa0Geico and Axe owned by Unilever UN 019UNIA 041ULVR 015Moreover esport team buyers include traditional sports teams owners or top executives at the New England Patriots the New York Mets and Comcast Spectator which owns the Philadelphia FlyersRead this about videogame earnings Esports are here to stay but who is poised to make a killingTwitch is the most popular platform for watching esports and competitive gaming online It\\x92s a big deal Average daily viewership for January was 962000 which means it did better than two major cable TV according to Mintel For 2017 average daily viewership was 885000 for MSNBC and 783000 for CNN Celebrities are catching on to the size of the Twitch audience and making appearances In March Drake played Fortnight with the popular gamer Tyler \\x93Ninja\\x94 BlevinsTwitch is one of Amazoncom\\x92s AMZN 010 bestkept secrets says Motely Fool writer John Ballard He thinks Amazon\\x92s 2014 purchase of Twitch for 970 million is starting to look like a really clever move Ballard describes Twitch a social network for gamers where viewers can watch their favorite streamers chat with other gamers and develop their skillsAs the biggest platform with about 70 of monthly active users in the online gaming space according to Goldman Sachs Twitch benefits from the \\x93network effect\\x94 This means it has the power to continually attract more users and become more useful to them as it does this Amazoncom makes money from Twitch by taking a cut of sales on the platform It has also integrated Twitch into Prime which helps Prime get more users \\x93Twitch represents one of the most compelling assets in the world of esports\\x94 says Goldman Sachs analyst Heath TerryOddly Amazon doesn\\x92t mention Twitch in its most recent 10Q It mentions it once in its most recent 10K but only as a formality and with no descriptionElectronic Arts looks like another good platform company to own Taking a page out of the books of Netflix NFLX 074 \\xa0and Spotify SPOT 342 Eletronic Arts is developing a streaming game service\\x93CEO Andrew Wilson is positioning the company for a future in which videogames are streamed to all devices via subscription\\x94 says Jefferies analyst Timothy O\\x92Shea The company will offer all its games on the service and it is working on adding thirdparty party titlesAccording to tech investing lore you do well investing in the companies that make the gear used in a tech trend and not just the companies selling the final products or services If that\\x92s true then Nvidia NVDA 030 \\xa0should continue to be a good investment It makes the highend GeForce line of graphics processing units GPUs used in the highpowered PCs that gamers like So the growing popularity of esports will help Nvidia\\x93We view Nvidia as uniquely positioned to
