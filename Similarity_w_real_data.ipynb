sending shares toward record highsThe company reported betterthanexpected results for its fiscal third quarter Tuesday posting earnings per share of 234 on revenue of 533 billion Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been projecting 216 in EPS and 523 billion in revenue Apple stock rose about 4 in afterhours trading to prices that would be record highs were they to occur during a regular trading sessionFor more on Apple earnings see our live blog recapThough Apple AAPL 020 \\xa0once again fell short of Wall Street\\x92s estimates for iPhone unit sales the company more than made up for that thanks to selling more of its premium iPhones Apple ended up with an iPhone average selling price of 724 in the June quarter which was far ahead of the 693 analysts were projecting The spring quarter typically brings the lowest average selling prices of the year as Apple nears the release of new iPhones but Apple saw a meaningful increase from the 606 it reported in the prior June quarterOpinion Apple earnings show why you can expect more 1000 iPhonesArguably the most useful number in Apple\\x92s fiscal thirdquarter report was its Septemberquarter outlook of 60 billion to 62 billion in revenue which came in above the FactSet consensus for 595 billion in revenue Typically investors look to Apple\\x92s September forecast for indications of whether the company expects to start selling new iPhones before that quarter ends Given Apple\\x92s revenue outperformance versus the consensus in the current quarter though Apple\\x92s optimism could also be due to product mixServices revenue has become an increasingly important element of Apple\\x92s business as it indicates how well the company is able to monetize its installed base of users amid what Chief Executive Tim Cook admitted was a lengthening upgrade cycle Apple reported 95 billion in services revenue for the latest period up from 73 billion in the yearearlier quarter Analysts had been projecting 92 billionSee also Here\\x92s what could happen to Apple\\x92s average selling prices in the next iPhone cycleOn the company\\x92s earnings call Cook shared more information about the services business and he was prompted by one analyst to discuss Apple\\x92s various streaming efforts He talked about how Apple\\x92s services segment was getting a boost from increased usage of thirdparty subscriptionvideo products within the Apple ecosystem Apple gets a cut of the subscription fee when consumers sign up for streaming services like Netflix Inc NFLX 074 \\xa0 and Cook suggested Apple is seeing growth in videostreaming subscription services at about 100 on a yearoveryear basisAs for Apple\\x92s own video content Cook said there was \\x93no match\\x94 for Oprah Winfrey\\x92s ability to connect with audiences \\x97 Apple has struck a deal with her He also said that two Sony veterans brought on last year were working on another exciting but secret project which could be a rumored streaming serviceDon\\x92t miss Here\\x92s how much Apple could make from streamingApple Music its streamingmusic service now has upward of 50 million users who either pay for the service or are using a free trial and Cook said he\\x92s \\x93been told\\x94 that the company \\x93took the leadership position in North America\\x94 this quarter He dismissed competitive concerns saying that the endgame for Apple and rival streamingmusic companies such as Spotify Technology SA SPOT 342 \\xa0and Pandora Media Inc P 246 \\xa0is to expand the category not go up against each otherStreaming music is part of Apple\\x92s services segment which has become an increasingly important element of Apple\\x92s business The company reported 95 billion in services revenue for the latest period up from 73 billion in the yearearlier quarter Analysts had been projecting 92 billionAnother closely watched area for Apple is China where the company has seen a recent rebound That trend continued in the most recent period which marked the company\\x92s fourthstraight quarter of doubledigit growth in Greater China Apple generated 96 billion in sales from Greater China up from 8 billion in the prior June quarterCook talked a good amount on the call about tariffs striking a balance between saying that certain trade relationships \\x93are in need of modernizing\\x94 but also that tariffs tend to show up \\x93as a tax on the consumer\\x94 As for tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as two other rounds of tariffs that affected 50 billion of Chinese goods Apple hasn\\x92t seen any of its products directly affected according to Cook The company is in the process of \\x93sharing our views with the administration\\x94 regarding a fourth round of tariffs that affects goods valued at 200

       "       'Judging by the ampedup energy inside Brooklyn\\x92s Barclays Center for the premier Overwatch League finals esports is here to stay \\x97 and it\\x92s going to be a big sustainable consumer trend that should have a place in your investment portfolioI\\x92m not an esports fan at least not yet But I went to last weekend\\x92s finals as an investor to see what all the fuss is about The atmosphere was electric especially considering that fans basically watched two teams lined up behind tables on stage playing games on a big screen above themLondon Fusion played Philadelphia Fusion in a soldout 20000seat arena and London won It wasn\\x92t quite up there with a Beatles show No second British Invasion But it was close And a lot more electric than most major league sports finalsThis enthusiasm is one reason Baird analyst Colin Sebastian thinks interactive entertainment will become the biggest piece of the media and entertainment sector hitting 145 billion in annual sales by 2020 That makes it a \\x93must own\\x94 area for investors he saysBut how Sebastian highlights content providers Activision Blizzard ATVI 092 Electronic Arts EA 201 and TakeTwo Interactive TTWO 008 Here\\x92s a look at these companies and six others that should be good plays on this trendVideogame publishers benefit directly because they own the esports leagues This brings in revenue via ticket sales merchandising media rights advertising and sponsorships They also benefit indirectly because esports will bring in more fans and help boost product salesHere are the four main companies in esports leagues so far\\x95 Tencent HoldingsTCEHY 0650700 034 \\xa0owns Riot Games whose League of Legends is one of the world\\x92s most popular games and the basis for the League of Legends Championship Series esports league Tencent is a key esports holding because it offers exposure to the popularity of esports in China its home turf China has the largest gamer base in the world with about 442 million gamers as of 2017 and a 57 penetration rate of Chinese internet users according to the China Internet Network Information Center This year China will contribute a third of the global game industry\\x92s total revenue says NewZooTencent has a deal with Disney DIS 083 \\xa0DIS for streaming and broadcast rights for League of Legends through 2023 and it is launching a competitivegaming television channel in China\\x95 Activision Blizzard owns the Overwatch League the league that played that final at the Barclays Center The league has 12 teams now but it wants to expand to 28 Activision Blizzard will also create an esports league for its Call of Duty game says Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher MerwinActivision Blizzard looks attractive for other reasons It already has a popular mobile game in Candy Crush A key source of growth will be the conversion of PC and consolebased titles into mobile games Mobile is huge in China So this could give it a greater presence in China where the company hopes to expand via a partnership with NetEase NTES 062Another catalyst for the stock should be the release of \\x93Call of Duty Black Ops 4\\x94 in October\\x93We believe Activision is building a Disneystyle entertainment business for the 21st century but with higher operating margins\\x94 says Jefferies analyst Timothy O\\x92SheaLike the shares of other game publishers Activision Blizzard stock can suffer bouts of weakness on fears about competition from Fortnite published by Epic Games But not to worry \\x93While undeniably the hottest game we\\x92ve seen in years Fortnite is more about expanding the market than cannibalizing it\\x94 says O\\x92SheaRead Want to make money off the \\x91Fortnite\\x92 videogame Buy this stock\\x95 TakeTwo Interactive has a partnership with the National Basketball Association to launch the NBA 2K eLeague\\x95 Electronic Arts is developing leagues based on its Fédération Internationale de Football Association FIFA and Madden NFL Football games It doesn\\x92t get much credit for this yet says Merwin So it could be the sleeper hereUnderscoring the financial muscle behind esports are the big brands that have signed on as sponsors They include Toyota TM 2337203 129 HP HPQ 009 Intel INTC 086 TMobile US TMUS 030 \\xa0 Nissan 7201 081 Berkshire Hathaway\\x92s BRKA 062BRKB 061 \\xa0Geico and Axe owned by Unilever UN 019UNIA 041ULVR 021Moreover esport team buyers include traditional sports teams owners or top executives at the New England Patriots the New York Mets and Comcast Spectator which owns the Philadelphia FlyersRead this about videogame earnings Esports are here to stay but who is poised to make a killingTwitch is the most popular platform for watching esports and competitive gaming online It\\x92s a big deal Average daily viewership for January was 962000 which means it did better than two major cable TV according to Mintel For 2017 average daily viewership was 885000 for MSNBC and 783000 for CNN Celebrities are catching on to the size of the Twitch audience and making appearances In March Drake played Fortnight with the popular gamer Tyler \\x93Ninja\\x94 BlevinsTwitch is one of Amazoncom\\x92s AMZN 010 bestkept secrets says Motely Fool writer John Ballard He thinks Amazon\\x92s 2014 purchase of Twitch for 970 million is starting to look like a really clever move Ballard describes Twitch a social network for gamers where viewers can watch their favorite streamers chat with other gamers and develop their skillsAs the biggest platform with about 70 of monthly active users in the online gaming space according to Goldman Sachs Twitch benefits from the \\x93network effect\\x94 This means it has the power to continually attract more users and become more useful to them as it does this Amazoncom makes money from Twitch by taking a cut of sales on the platform It has also integrated Twitch into Prime which helps Prime get more users \\x93Twitch represents one of the most compelling assets in the world of esports\\x94 says Goldman Sachs analyst Heath TerryOddly Amazon doesn\\x92t mention Twitch in its most recent 10Q It mentions it once in its most recent 10K but only as a formality and with no descriptionElectronic Arts looks like another good platform company to own Taking a page out of the books of Netflix NFLX 074 \\xa0and Spotify SPOT 342 Eletronic Arts is developing a streaming game service\\x93CEO Andrew Wilson is positioning the company for a future in which videogames are streamed to all devices via subscription\\x94 says Jefferies analyst Timothy O\\x92Shea The company will offer all its games on the service and it is working on adding thirdparty party titlesAccording to tech investing lore you do well investing in the companies that make the gear used in a tech trend and not just the companies selling the final products or services If that\\x92s true then Nvidia NVDA 030 \\xa0should continue to be a good investment It makes the

       "       'Judging by the ampedup energy inside Brooklyn\\x92s Barclays Center for the premier Overwatch League finals esports is here to stay \\x97 and it\\x92s going to be a big sustainable consumer trend that should have a place in your investment portfolioI\\x92m not an esports fan at least not yet But I went to last weekend\\x92s finals as an investor to see what all the fuss is about The atmosphere was electric especially considering that fans basically watched two teams lined up behind tables on stage playing games on a big screen above themLondon Fusion played Philadelphia Fusion in a soldout 20000seat arena and London won It wasn\\x92t quite up there with a Beatles show No second British Invasion But it was close And a lot more electric than most major league sports finalsThis enthusiasm is one reason Baird analyst Colin Sebastian thinks interactive entertainment will become the biggest piece of the media and entertainment sector hitting 145 billion in annual sales by 2020 That makes it a \\x93must own\\x94 area for investors he saysBut how Sebastian highlights content providers Activision Blizzard ATVI 092 Electronic Arts EA 201 and TakeTwo Interactive TTWO 008 Here\\x92s a look at these companies and six others that should be good plays on this trendVideogame publishers benefit directly because they own the esports leagues This brings in revenue via ticket sales merchandising media rights advertising and sponsorships They also benefit indirectly because esports will bring in more fans and help boost product salesHere are the four main companies in esports leagues so far\\x95 Tencent HoldingsTCEHY 0650700 045 \\xa0owns Riot Games whose League of Legends is one of the world\\x92s most popular games and the basis for the League of Legends Championship Series esports league Tencent is a key esports holding because it offers exposure to the popularity of esports in China its home turf China has the largest gamer base in the world with about 442 million gamers as of 2017 and a 57 penetration rate of Chinese internet users according to the China Internet Network Information Center This year China will contribute a third of the global game industry\\x92s total revenue says NewZooTencent has a deal with Disney DIS 083 \\xa0DIS for streaming and broadcast rights for League of Legends through 2023 and it is launching a competitivegaming television channel in China\\x95 Activision Blizzard owns the Overwatch League the league that played that final at the Barclays Center The league has 12 teams now but it wants to expand to 28 Activision Blizzard will also create an esports league for its Call of Duty game says Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher MerwinActivision Blizzard looks attractive for other reasons It already has a popular mobile game in Candy Crush A key source of growth will be the conversion of PC and consolebased titles into mobile games Mobile is huge in China So this could give it a greater presence in China where the company hopes to expand via a partnership with NetEase NTES 062Another catalyst for the stock should be the release of \\x93Call of Duty Black Ops 4\\x94 in October\\x93We believe Activision is building a Disneystyle entertainment business for the 21st century but with higher operating margins\\x94 says Jefferies analyst Timothy O\\x92SheaLike the shares of other game publishers Activision Blizzard stock can suffer bouts of weakness on fears about competition from Fortnite published by Epic Games But not to worry \\x93While undeniably the hottest game we\\x92ve seen in years Fortnite is more about expanding the market than cannibalizing it\\x94 says O\\x92SheaRead Want to make money off the \\x91Fortnite\\x92 videogame Buy this stock\\x95 TakeTwo Interactive has a partnership with the National Basketball Association to launch the NBA 2K eLeague\\x95 Electronic Arts is developing leagues based on its Fédération Internationale de Football Association FIFA and Madden NFL Football games It doesn\\x92t get much credit for this yet says Merwin So it could be the sleeper hereUnderscoring the financial muscle behind esports are the big brands that have signed on as sponsors They include Toyota TM 2337203 129 HP HPQ 009 Intel INTC 086 TMobile US TMUS 030 \\xa0 Nissan 7201 081 Berkshire Hathaway\\x92s BRKA 062BRKB 061 \\xa0Geico and Axe owned by Unilever UN 019UNIA 041ULVR 015Moreover esport team buyers include traditional sports teams owners or top executives at the New England Patriots the New York Mets and Comcast Spectator which owns the Philadelphia FlyersRead this about videogame earnings Esports are here to stay but who is poised to make a killingTwitch is the most popular platform for watching esports and competitive gaming online It\\x92s a big deal Average daily viewership for January was 962000 which means it did better than two major cable TV according to Mintel For 2017 average daily viewership was 885000 for MSNBC and 783000 for CNN Celebrities are catching on to the size of the Twitch audience and making appearances In March Drake played Fortnight with the popular gamer Tyler \\x93Ninja\\x94 BlevinsTwitch is one of Amazoncom\\x92s AMZN 010 bestkept secrets says Motely Fool writer John Ballard He thinks Amazon\\x92s 2014 purchase of Twitch for 970 million is starting to look like a really clever move Ballard describes Twitch a social network for gamers where viewers can watch their favorite streamers chat with other gamers and develop their skillsAs the biggest platform with about 70 of monthly active users in the online gaming space according to Goldman Sachs Twitch benefits from the \\x93network effect\\x94 This means it has the power to continually attract more users and become more useful to them as it does this Amazoncom makes money from Twitch by taking a cut of sales on the platform It has also integrated Twitch into Prime which helps Prime get more users \\x93Twitch represents one of the most compelling assets in the world of esports\\x94 says Goldman Sachs analyst Heath TerryOddly Amazon doesn\\x92t mention Twitch in its most recent 10Q It mentions it once in its most recent 10K but only as a formality and with no descriptionElectronic Arts looks like another good platform company to own Taking a page out of the books of Netflix NFLX 074 \\xa0and Spotify SPOT 342 Eletronic Arts is developing a streaming game service\\x93CEO Andrew Wilson is positioning the company for a future in which videogames are streamed to all devices via subscription\\x94 says Jefferies analyst Timothy O\\x92Shea The company will offer all its games on the service and it is working on adding thirdparty party titlesAccording to tech investing lore you do well investing in the companies that make the gear used in a tech trend and not just the companies selling the final products or services If that\\x92s true then Nvidia NVDA 030 \\xa0should continue to be a good investment It makes the highend GeForce line of graphics processing units GPUs used in the highpowered PCs that gamers like So the growing popularity of esports will help Nvidia\\x93We view Nvidia as uniquely positioned to
