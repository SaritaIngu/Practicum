TSLA,08/08/2018 14:33,SEC questions Tesla over Elon Musk’s tweets to take the company private,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sec-questions-tesla-over-elon-musks-tweets-to-take-the-company-private-2018-08-08,"WASHINGTON — Securities regulators have inquired with Tesla Inc. about Chief Executive Elon Musk’s surprise announcement that he may take the company private and whether his claim was factual, people familiar with the matter said.The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked whether Musk’s unusual announcement on Tuesday was factual, the people said. The regulator also asked Tesla TSLA, -2.43%   about why the disclosure was made on Twitter rather than in a regulatory filing, and whether the company believes the announcement complies with investor-protection rules, the people said.Read: Musk’s plan to take Tesla private while allowing outside shareholders would prove cumbersomeMusk on Tuesday proposed taking Tesla private at $420 a share, about 11% higher than the day’s closing stock price. He called the funding “secured” for what would be the biggest-ever corporate buyout, but he hasn’t disclosed details. A group of Tesla board members on Wednesday said Musk spoke to them last week about taking the company private.The SEC’s inquiries, which originated from its San Francisco office, suggest Tesla could come under an enforcement investigation if regulators develop evidence that Musk’s statement was misleading or false. It wasn’t immediately clear on Wednesday whether the regulator had opened a formal enforcement investigation based on the answers it received from the company. An SEC spokesman declined to comment.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.Also popular on WSJ.com:On U.S. planes, the dogs are winning.N.Y.

Then the CEO released a blog post expanding on his deliberations, which you can read here. On Wednesday, the shares fell about 2%.What to do now? Let us explore the legal inside information that can help you trade Tesla if you desire to do so.Please click here for the annotated chart of Tesla TSLA, -2.43% Note the following from the chart:• The chart shows the VUD indicator. This is the most sensitive indicator of net supply and demand in real time. The indicator is positive but less than would have been expected. The interpretation is two-fold. First, there are not many believers in the transaction actually happening. Second, short-sellers, who bet on a decline in the share price, have not covered their positions during this rise.• Based on the latest information available, 29% of shares outstanding have been sold short. In our analysis, the actual number is likely higher.• If a short squeeze starts, meaning short-sellers would have to cover their positions by buying the stock, the stock could rocket toward $420 long before any transaction is finalized.• There obviously is high risk in buying the stock now. The chart shows support points. Stops can be put below these support points.• It is advisable to put stops in tranches. We are providing to The Arora Report subscribers the exact size of tranches and stop zones.• Since the stock can be halted or gap down on the next day, stop loss orders may not protect you. For this reason, stops should be only your second line of defense. The first line of defense is the position size. Another way to protect yourself is to buy put options. However, this may not be practical for many given the high cost of put options. One way to reduce the cost of put options is to buy put spreads.• The overall risk-reward in this trade is attractive, but this is suitable only for aggressive investors as the risk of loss is high.Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies.

TSLA,08/08/2018 12:45,Musk’s plan to take Tesla private while allowing outside shareholders would prove cumbersome,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/musks-plan-to-take-tesla-private-while-allowing-outside-shareholders-would-prove-cumbersome-2018-08-08,"Going private is not as easy as it looks, especially if you go down a path proposed by the mercurial Elon Musk, founder and largest shareholder of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -2.43%  .Musk’s tweet on Tuesday proposed returning Tesla, the electronic car company, to private ownership to give shareholders, especially his employee shareholders, a chance to avoid stock price volatility that “can be a major distraction” and allow the company maintain its focus on long-term goals. Also, as the “most shorted stock in the history of the stock market,” Musk believes many people have an incentive to “attack” the company, attacks Musk has responded to in a way critics and short-sellers say is not appropriate for a public company CEO.He told Tesla employees in an email shortly afterward, “I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%). My hope is for all shareholders to remain, but if they prefer to be bought out, then this would enable that to happen at a nice premium.”See also: Elon Musk explained his going-private tweet to Tesla employees with this emailIn a follow-on tweet, he explained that his “hope” is that all current investors would remain Tesla shareholders even if its private would be accomplished by creating a “special purpose fund” as he said he and executives of his other private company private do with ”Fidelity’s investment in SpaceX.”See also: Tesla’s going-private proposal has analysts ‘as confused as anyone else’Back in January of 2013, Musk responded to a growing push by SpaceX employees for that company to go public by saying that Tesla, and its subsidiary SolarCity, had IPOd “because they didn’t have any choice. Their private capital structure was becoming unwieldy and they needed to raise a lot of equity capital.”Musk is now using the same reasons for Tesla going private as he cited to the SpaceX employees.A deal to go private again would be structured like SpaceX, he told employees in an email. All Tesla employees would remain shareholders, just like at SpaceX, and external and employee shareholders would have an opportunity to sell or buy shares approximately every six months.“Some at SpaceX who have not been through a public company experience may think that being public is desirable,” Musk wrote in 2013. “This is not so. Public company stocks, particularly if big step changes in technology are involved, go through extreme volatility, both for reasons of internal execution and for reasons that have nothing to do with anything except the economy. This causes people to be distracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of creating great products.”John Coates, a professor of law and economics at Harvard Law School, told MarketWatch in an email, “I know of no legal way to offer public shareholders of a listed company an equity security while also going private. I also know of no legal way to offer $X billion worth securities of any kind to more than 35 unaccredited investors without registering with the SEC.”There are now some opportunities for smaller offerings of securities, $5 million or less in any 12-month period, but those are restricted to 35 retail investors or less.Securities laws require companies to go public via a traditional full initial public offering registered with the SEC if they have more than $10 million in total assets and a class of equity securities, like common stock, that is held of record by either 2,000 or more persons or 500 or more persons who are not accredited investors.These requirements are intended partly to avoid an unequal distribution of information between potential retail investors and large accredited investors when a company is private and no public disclosure is required.Tesla has 169.8 million shares outstanding but only 126.9 million in public float, that is, shares that are actually available for trading. Approximately 25.3 % of its shares are held by insiders, including Elon Musk who holds 37.9 million shares or 21.9% of the outstanding shares as of the date of the company’s last proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.As of Dec. 31, Tesla, Inc. had 37,543 full-time employees, most who hold Tesla shares.Public company status and listing on an exchange also avoids the complicated private accounting for shareholder interests that develops when companies have thousands of investors of very different sizes and financial sophistication. Musk may be thinking of the structure used by traditional venture capital funds for angel investors to primarily invest in early stage investments, set up as a pooled investment vehicle in a limited partnership or limited liability company, an LP or LLC. This structure enables a group of investors, usually individuals, to invest collectively.“The closest I could imagine to what seems to be Musk’s idea is to create a new hedge or private equity fund, limited to accredited investors, offering limited partner interests in exchange for Tesla stock,” said Coates, “and, then, for a combination of large direct investors to buy stock from Tesla and then in some fashion cash out the remaining public investors.”“A mutual fund could possibly also invest in the ongoing company, which would allow unaccredited investors an ability to invest indirectly in it,” Coates added. “But the fund would have to live with diversification requirements that would make it not only an indirect but also a diluted form of Tesla ownership.”Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

TSLA,08/08/2018 12:45,Tesla analysts say they’re ‘as confused as anyone else’,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-going-private-proposal-has-analysts-as-confused-as-anyone-else-2018-08-08,"Wall Street had more questions than answers Wednesday as analysts sifted through the Tesla Inc. going-private news bombshell.Tesla TSLA, -2.43%  Chief Executive Elon Musk roiled markets Tuesday by tweeting he was “considering” taking the Silicon Valley car maker private, and the company later posted on its website an email to employees from Musk expanding on the idea.Other than the “funding secured” claim in the original tweet, however, few details have emerged about how it would finance such a massive deal. Several board members on Wednesday confirmed that Tesla had raised the idea a week ago, but did not indicate whether they were in favor.“Frankly, we’re as confused as anyone else,” analysts at Bernstein said in a note, going on to line up eight questions around Musk’s wish to take Tesla private at $420 a share while offering few details on how to go about it.Read more: Tesla short sellers walloped after Musk talks going privateFor the shares, there’s upside risk in the near term to perhaps $400, but downside risk to $340, Tuesday’s low, or below “if no firmer details emerge, as investors would likely increasingly debate Musk’s credibility and over-focus on the shares’ price and volatility,” the Bernstein analysts said.Tesla shares fell 1.4% Wednesday, trading as low as $367.12, after ending at $379.57 Tuesday, an 11% advance and their highest since a Sept. 18 record high of $385.The Bernstein analysts said they got confirmation from Tesla’s investor relations that Musk’s talk about financing was correct.Tesla’s enterprise value hovers around $80 billion, and estimates on how much Tesla would need in financing to cinch the deal varied and depended on assumptions on whether a significant number of investors would not tender their shares, as Musk seemed to indicate when he mentioned having investor support.Musk has a 20% stake, around $13 billion, which he said would remain the same.Whoever steps in to buy Tesla at $420, when the stock traded around $300 last week, would be “clearly someone who wants a majority (or a very large stake),” which leaves only a few pockets deep enough, including Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund, which reportedly took a stake in Tesla this week but according to a report on The Wall Street Journal had no plans to expand it.Musk and Softbank Group Corp. 9984, +4.78%  Chief Executive Masayoshi Son held talks last year, including about potentially taking the car maker private, but the discussions fell through “due to disagreements over ownership,” according to a Bloomberg News report that cited two people with knowledge of the discussions.Analysts at Evercore ISI also zeroed in the lack of details around “funding secured.”See also: Elon Musk explained his going-private tweet to Tesla employees with this emailA “possible scenario” would be 50% to 60% of existing shareholders, including Musk’s 20% holdings, continue, “with their holdings rolled into a new private structure,” the Evercore ISI analysts said.That would leave Tesla needing to raise equity capital of $31 billion to $39 billion to buy out those existing public shareholders who tender; 40% to 50% of Tesla’s implied $78 billion market value, and assuming debt is rolled, they said.Related: Call of the day: Tesla shares are headed for $420 regardlessThe more likely route to that $31 billion-$39 billion would be a combination of a strategic investor, two to three private investment firms or sovereign-wealth funds, and “certain larger members of the existing shareholder base or some form of fund for smaller accredited investors making up the delta,” they said.Aside from not having to answer to markets in the short term, as Musk pointed out in his email, the Evercore ISI saw one advantage of going private —it could provide Tesla with deeper pockets to grow internationally at a faster rate, and security through the next U.S./capital markets recession where public funding would dry up, they said.Analysts at J.P. Morgan raised their price target on Tesla on Wednesday to $308 from a previous $195, then one of the lowest among major investment banks. They are “not as certain” as Musk that Tesla will go private, so assigned a 50% probability to the scenario in their updated valuation.See also: Tesla bonds jump more than 2 points after CEO Musk mulls going-private transaction“We continue to believe Tesla’s valuation based on fundamentals alone ... is worth no more than $195,” the analysts said. “But introducing a new 50% weighting of $420 suggests a large upward revision to our price target is warranted, and we newly value Tesla at $308 per share (i.e., 50/50 blend of $195 and $420).”Analysts at Goldman Sachs recalled Dell’s $25 billion buyout in 2013, only to reject that as a perfect case study for Tesla.“While the transaction was somewhat similar in nature to what is being proposed at TSLA, the EBITDA generation and cash flow characteristics of the business were very different given a more mature product and growth profile,” the analysts said. Dell’s reported 2013 adjusted EBITDA was $5.1 billion, and free cash flow generation was about $3 billion.Tesla’s free cash flow was a negative $739 million in its latest quarter.Goldman kept its sell rating and six-month price target on Tesla at $210, also one of the lowest on the Street.Piper Jaffray analysts assigned a low likelihood the deal would come to pass.Tesla would not be going private “anytime soon,” they said, as many details remain “unknowable” and as result “the deal is unlikely to succeed in the very near-term, if it succeeds at all,” the analysts said.For the “true believers with a multi-year time horizon,” the suggested go-private valuation would be “unpalatable,” and gaining shareholder approval would be easier than gaining funding, the analysts said.Tesla shares rose 20% this year, compared with gains of 7% and 3.6% for the S&P 500 index                          SPX, -0.03%                   and Dow Jones Industrial Average.

TSLA,08/08/2018 08:45,Tesla board statement raises more questions about Elon Musk’s go-private plan,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-board-statement-raises-more-questions-about-elon-musks-go-private-plan-2018-08-08,"A statement from Tesla’s board members on Wednesday raises further questions following the shock tweet from Elon Musk that he wants to take the auto maker private.The brief news release from Tesla board members—Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Linda Johnson Rice, and James Murdoch—consisted of three sentences:Two board members, venture capital investor Steve Jurvetson as well as Musk’s brother, Kimbal Musk, didn’t sign on to the statement. (Jurvetson has taken leave from Tesla after being accused of sexual harassment.)The statement from members of Tesla Inc.’s TSLA, -2.43% board does show there was a discussion of how he could fund such a bid. But the board’s statement leaves open the crucial question of whether they were satisfied that—as Musk’s surprise tweet put it—he had enough backing to assert “funding secured.”At $420 a share, the price at which Musk tweeted he was considering setting the bid, the deal would be valued at $72 billion before debt.Related: A Tesla buyout would be the largest in history—by a wide marginTesla shares were down more than 1% early Wednesday, after surging by about 11% on Tuesday. The electric-car maker’s stock has climbed by 21% so far this year. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.18%   is set for a year-to-date gain of 3.5%, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.03%   is on track for a return of 6.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.06%   has advanced by more than 14% so far this year, according to FactSet data. Tesla’s run-up comes despite the company being a consistent target of investors aiming to short the its stock, or bet against Tesla’s shares rising.Another crucial question raised by the statement is the timing. “Last week” predates Tesla’s filing on Monday of its 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which didn’t mention such discussions.News of a takeover would certainly be considered material, yet it wasn’t disclosed until Musk’s tweet on Tuesday.Another question is what the “appropriate next steps” are, though that’s probably the imminent formation of a committee to evaluate the bid.What was left out of the statement also is worth considering. For instance, there was no indication that the board was satisfied with either Musk’s method or timing for announcing the approach, though they didn’t rebuke him, either.Murdoch also sits on the board of News Corp., which owns MarketWatch, the publisher of this report.Related: Did Elon Musk break any laws with his going-private tweet?Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

TSLA,08/08/2018 07:45,Tesla: Is $420 a Share Too Low for a Deal?,https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-is-420-a-share-too-low-for-a-deal-1533737967,"There are plenty of things one might wonder about yesterday’s revelations that Elon Musk is “considering” taking Tesla (TSLA) private—among them, how a deal might be funded and structured and, of course…was Musk making a pot joke?Some have wondered whether the Muskian tweet that started all this might lead to regulatory trouble. And then there’s the question: Is $420 a share even enough? At least one analyst—who, it should be noted, is among the Street’s more optimistic regarding the Barron’s Next 50 company’s shares—thinks it isn’t.“We do not think Tesla shareholders view the $420 per share mark as an adequate premium for a go-private transaction, and therefore we think investors could look for a higher price,” Baird’s Ben Kallo wrote Wednesday, citing “recent conversations with investors.”“We think shareholders will demand a higher price for a potential go-private transaction, which could cause shares to trade above $420, particularly as shorts may cover positions,” according to Kallo. “We expect the stock to move higher as the story develops.”Baird, which currently has a $411 price target on Tesla’s shares, isn’t the most-bullish analyst tracked by FactSet. Its price target is 9% above current levels and roughly 28% over FactSet’s mean around $322; some analysts are at or above $500.Barron’s has examined the latest Tesla news from a range of perspectives. Andrew Bary suggested caution for investors looking to play the arbitrage game. Ben Levisohn offered reasons why going private would appeal to Musk. Randall Forsythe examined the company’s convertible bonds.Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock—currently up about 17% in 2018—was quiet Wednesday morning after a busy Tuesday. Will investors, as Baird suggests, push for a bigger premium?The company’s board issued a broad statement Wednesday, saying that recent conversations have touched on strategic and financial questions regarding a deal—though major details, generally speaking, haven’t been disclosed (or otherwise filtered out).Meanwhile, other analysts were wary. The more bearish JP Morgan, for example, raised its price target but kept it below current levels, figuring that a 50% chance of a deal as currently understood “suggests a large upward revision to our price target is warranted.”“As surprising to us as these developments are, and as lacking as the statements are in any details regarding who is expected to provide the required amount of financing and on what terms, they are nevertheless declarative statements from the CEO of a public company which we feel should be considered seriously,” JP Morgan wrote.Email David Marino-Nachison at david.marino-nachison@barrons.com.

TSLA,08/08/2018 05:45,These 5 tech stocks are in a dot-com-like bubble (and they aren’t all FAANGs),http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-5-tech-stocks-are-in-a-dot-com-like-bubble-and-they-arent-all-faangs-2018-08-08,"Although the overall stock market looks reasonably valued, there are pockets of extraordinary risk where stocks with 2000-bubble-like valuations lurk.Specifically, there is a “micro bubble” in certain tech stocks, where valuations reflect expectations for future cash flows that would require unrealistically high margins, growth, and market share. These expectations might not be so “bubbly” if not for the fact that the current margins and cash flows of these companies have trended at very low or negative levels for years.Figure 1 lists the five tech stocks we put in our first micro bubble. They share a few key characteristics:• Low or negative return on invested capital (ROIC) and free cash flow• Unrealistically high valuations: all 10 companies either have negative economic book values, or they have a PEBV above 20• Expectations that they achieve heretofore unseen dominant market sharesThese are five of the largest micro-bubble companies. Briefly, here’s what makes each of these companies part of the micro-bubble.Fun fact: Amazon’s AMZN, +1.29% $885 billion market cap is higher than Walmart WMT, +0.31% Home Depot HD, +0.49% Oracle ORCL, -0.19%  and Disney DIS, -2.21%  combined. Investors are betting that Amazon can grow to dominate multiple industries while earning significantly higher margins than it does now.Amazon has finally shown an ability to earn a profit, but it still must grow net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 30% compounded annually for 19 years to justify its current valuation. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario. For comparison, only six companies in the S&P 500 SPX, -0.03%  managed to grow NOPAT by 30% compounded annually for just the past 10 years. Maintaining that growth rate for nearly double that time frame would be an extraordinary feat.Amazon prefers to point investors to free cash flow, but its reported free cash flow numbers are an illusion. In reality, the company continues to experience significant cash outflows.Investors who focus on understanding true cash flow and fundamentals know the disconnect between actual cash flow and the market’s expectations for future cash flows borders on the absurd.Netflix NFLX, -1.20% has become one of the leading creators of original content, but it’s done so with an unsustainable cost structure. As this excellent video from The Ringer explains, Netflix earns an accounting profit, but only because its reported content costs understate its actual content spending by about 50%. The company continues to lose billions of dollars a year and grows increasingly dependent on the high-yield debt market.Felix Salmon of Slate recently published a piece titled “Netflix Can Either Become the Dominant Media Monopoly of the 21st Century or Go Bust.” The market values Netflix as if it will be that dominant monopoly when, frankly, there’s a very good chance it goes bust. Risk/reward for this stock is so bad that no investor with any respect for fundamentals can own this stock in good conscience.Salesforce CRM, +0.51%  has racked up losses for years while pursuing growth at any cost. The theory behind this strategy is that the company will eventually be able to cut back heavily on its marketing and R&D costs while maintaining its recurring revenue stream.Even if this strategy does work, which is far from certain, the company is currently valued at 10 times revenue, or double the valuation of Oracle. This hasn’t dissuaded bulls, as Salesforce generates classic tech bubble-style headlines like “Ignore Salesforce’s Valuation.” In other words, they want investors to ignore fundamentals.Tesla TSLA, -2.43% currently has a higher market cap than GM GM, +0.21%  despite selling about 1% as many cars in 2017. What’s more, GM is already ahead of Tesla in self-driving technology and rapidly catching up when it comes to electric vehicle production.Elon Musk keeps promising that Tesla will revolutionize the auto industry, but so far Tesla hasn’t shown an ability to navigate the manufacturing logistics that the established auto makers figured out decades ago. The company’s valuation is blind to fundamentals and seems entirely focused on the cult of personality that has built up around Musk.Read: Tesla confirms intention to go private, sending stock up 11%Spotify Technology SPOT, -0.46%  wants to disrupt the music industry, but so far it remains beholden to the Big Three record labels that own 85% of the music streamed on its platform. The market thinks of Spotify as a trendy tech company, but as we wrote in our report on the stock, the economics of its business are more similar to the movie theater industry.Spotify’s leverage against the record labels is further weakened by the rapid growth of competitors like Apple MusicAAPL, +0.07% It’s hard to see how Spotify can justify the growth expectations implied by its valuation unless it could pull off the unlikely feat of taking over ownership of its content from the labels while holding off competition from other streaming services (all without having to overspend like Netflix has).Again, we see a company where the valuation reflects the best-case scenario with little to no tether to fundamentals.Investors that want to bet against these micro-bubble stocks can short them directly, but that can be expensive and risky for these momentum-driven companies. As the saying goes, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.Another way to profit from the busting of this micro bubble is to invest in the incumbents from which these companies must take major chunks of market share. When these micro-bubble stocks fall back to earth, a great deal of capital should be reallocated to the incumbents.Today’s market has some micro bubbles, or smaller groups of overhyped stocks trading at ridiculous valuations.That makes it very different from the tech bubble, which was a macro bubble, a marketwide phenomenon that distorted the valuation of the entire market.A few new features are shaping the market now and explain why today’s bubbles are unlikely to spread to the entire market, at least for the foreseeable future:• Politicians and policy makers are focused on preventing macro market crashes. Today’s politicians and policy makers are heavily shaped by both the housing bubble of the mid-2000s and the tech bubble of the late 1990s. They will likely do everything in their power to prevent recurrence of such cataclysmic events on their watch.• Rising influence of noise traders. Noise traders, who make investment decisions based on noise and have no regard for fundamentals, are an increasingly influential force in today’s market. Roughly a quarter of all U.S. adults with internet access are retail online traders. That’s around 50 million investors who don’t have professional trading (much less investing) experience and might be more susceptible to buying into “story” stocks without understanding the fundamentals. There’s power in those numbers.• Overhyping “transformative” technology. The splintering of online media has led journalists to overhype nearly every new technology and trend in a relentless competition for clicks. For example, despite the “Retail Apocalypse” narrative, brick-and-mortar sales still account for 90% of retail sales, and Walmart earned nearly three times more revenue than Amazon last year. In reality, very few new technologies are as transformative as we like to imagine.• Value transfer vs. value creation. Too many investors overestimate the value-creation opportunities for new technologies. Even when technologies are transformative, predicting who will reap the benefits of these technologies is difficult. Often, most of the value accrues to end users/consumers and not corporations. When it does accrue to a company, it’s usually at the expense of another company. During the tech bubble, bulls believed the internet would make our economy radically more productive and allow the GDP growth rate of around 5% in the late 90’s to persist for many years. When this utopian future failed to materialize, the market collapsed. By contrast, today’s micro-bubble companies compete against firmly established incumbents from which they must take large chunks of market share to survive. Instead of adding value, these companies aim to take value from existing players. Even if they succeed, we think much of that value will eventually pass to consumers.This last point is key. In 1999, investors gave Microsoft MSFT, +0.56%  its absurdly high valuation because they believed its software would create enormous amounts of value and growth for thousands of other companies. On the other hand, Tesla’s sky-high valuation implies it will take market share away from General Motors and Ford F, -0.30% which decreases the valuation of those companies.These modern-day micro bubbles reflect the zero-sum nature of today’s crowded and more mature competitive landscapes.Figure 2 sums up the difference between the tech bubble and today’s market pretty clearly. It shows the price to economic book value (PEBV) of the largest 1,000 U.S. stocks by market cap going back to 2000. PEBV compares the current valuation of a company compared to the zero-growth value of its cash flows, i.e. NOPAT, so a higher PEBV means the market expects more future cash flow growth.While the market’s PEBV has more than doubled since 2012, from 0.7 to 1.5, it’s nowhere close to its tech bubble level of 5.7.There are definitely some outrageously valued companies out there, but those high valuations haven’t spread to the rest of the market. People forget that high valuations weren’t confined to tech stocks in the late 90’s. At the height of the tech bubble, Walmart had a P/E ratio of 46 and a PEBV of 5.1. Currently it has a P/E of 30 (artificially inflated by a $3 billion loss on debt refinancing) and a PEBV of 0.9.Bubble alarmists are hyping up the valuations of a subset of stocks while ignoring the rest of the market.David Trainer is the CEO of New Constructs, an equity research firm that uses machine learning and natural language processing to parse corporate filings and model economic earnings.

Funding secured.The price would represent 16% upside from Tesla’s TSLA, -2.43%  price on Tuesday and value the company around $72 billion.He appeared to be doubling down on the “420,” which in certain circles is a coded word meaning marijuana.420Later he tweeted to say he “won’t be selling.”I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.Musk also tweeted he’d hope “all” investors would remain with Tesla even if it went private, and that he’d “ensure” the prosperity of Tesla shareholders. When asked whether he’d remain CEO, he tweeted “no change.”Later on, he tweeted:Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother & less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.Tesla’s high-yield bonds rallied after Musk’s Twitter volleys. The 5.300% notes that mature in August of 2025 were last trading at 90.399 cents on the dollar to yield 7.058%, or at a yield spread of 409 basis points over Treasurys, a full 53 basis points tighter on the week.In going private, Tesla would be under less public scrutiny and less criticism, but the move would be unlikely to have a broader impact on the U.S. auto industry, said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with Autotrader.Musk in April tweeted a joke that Tesla had gone bankrupt amid the company’s worst month in seven years. The stock fell 5% the following day.Tesla shares were recently up 5%, and earlier on Tuesday had gotten a boost from news that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund has taken a significant stake in the company.Tesla last week reported mixed second-quarter results, but the stock has rallied as Wall Street seized on the company’s renewed promises of profitability for the second half of the year and on Musk’s demeanor during a post-results conference call with analysts.“Market perception of Elon Musk appears to have improved significantly from the lows following the previous conference call and recent social media activity,” analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note Tuesday. “We can’t put a value on this, but it’s clearly important. The apologies and self-awareness expressed on the call triggered an immediate positive market reaction.”Investors had called for a Twitter “sabbatical” for Musk after the CEO last month called a diver involved in the Thai cave rescue of a youth soccer team a “pedo.” Musk later apologized to the man and to the companies he leads.Tesla’s revenue growth number, however, was artificially inflated by its adoption of a new revenue recognition rule for the second quarter that it compared with a revenue number calculated under the old rule, as MarketWatch’s Francine McKenna has reported.Tesla shares have gained 16% this year, compared with gains around 7% for the S&P 500                          SPX, -0.03%                   and 4% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

TSLA,08/08/2018 05:45,Elon Musk explained his going-private tweet to Tesla employees with this email,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-explained-his-going-private-tweet-to-tesla-employees-with-this-email-2018-08-07,"The following is the full text of Telsa Inc. TSLA, -2.43%  Chief Executive Elon Musk’s email to staff today regarding a going-private transaction:Taking Tesla Private7 August 2018The following email was sent to Tesla employees today:Earlier today, I announced that I’m considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420/share. I wanted to let you know my rationale for this, and why I think this is the best path forward.First, a final decision has not yet been made, but the reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best. As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.I fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we’re all trying to achieve.This is especially true for a company like Tesla that has a long-term, forward-looking mission. SpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is privately held. This is not to say that it will make sense for Tesla to be private over the long-term. In the future, once Tesla enters a phase of slower, more predictable growth, it will likely make sense to return to the public markets.Here’s what I envision being private would mean for all shareholders, including all of our employees.First, I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%). My hope is for all shareholders to remain, but if they prefer to be bought out, then this would enable that to happen at a nice premium.Second, my intention is for all Tesla employees to remain shareholders of the company, just as is the case at SpaceX. If we were to go private, employees would still be able to periodically sell their shares and exercise their options. This would enable you to still share in the growing value of the company that you have all worked so hard to build over time.Third, the intention is not to merge SpaceX and Tesla. They would continue to have separate ownership and governance structures. However, the structure envisioned for Tesla is similar in many ways to the SpaceX structure: external shareholders and employee shareholders have an opportunity to sell or buy approximately every six months.Finally, this has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself. I own about 20% of the company now, and I don’t envision that being substantially different after any deal is completed.Basically, I’m trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees, as possible.This proposal to go private would ultimately be finalized through a vote of our shareholders. If the process ends the way I expect it will, a private Tesla would ultimately be an enormous opportunity for all of us. Either way, the future is very bright and we’ll keep fighting to achieve our mission.Thanks,ElonRead now: Tesla confirms intention to go private, sending stock up 11%Join the conversation"
