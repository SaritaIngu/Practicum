TSLA,2018-08-09 16:21:36.567272,Here’s what the junk-bond market says about Tesla going private,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-the-junk-bond-market-is-saying-about-teslas-going-private-proposal-2018-08-09,"The corporate bond market seems to be betting that the going-private transaction mooted by Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk earlier this week will not materialize, or at least not in any conventional way.Tesla TSLA, -4.83%  bonds, which unusually for debt tend to track the stock’s performance, initially jumped after Musk shocked investors with a tweet saying he had secured funding for a possible deal at $420. They have retreated now and are nowhere near a price that would suggest bondholders expect any deal to take place.The 5.300% notes that mature in August of 2025 were last trading at 91.175 cents on the dollar to yield 6.910%, or at a yield spread of 397 basis points over Treasurys, 18 basis points wider on the day. The bonds traded above 93 cents on Wednesday at their peak.Read more: Tesla analysts say they’re ‘as confused as anyone else’The bond’s covenants, the provisions that are supposed to protect the bondholders, include a mechanism that would give the holders the right to sell their bonds at 101 cents on the dollar if certain conditions are met.That mechanism, a change of control put, would only be triggered if any person or group ends up owning more than 50% of the voting stock of Tesla or a newly created holding company, and if two of the major bond ratings agencies, S&P Global and Moody’s Investors Service, were to downgrade the debt below the agencies’ issue-date rating.See also: Tesla short sellers walloped after Musk talks going privateAt issuance, the $1.8 billion of notes were rated at B- by S&P and B3 by Moody’s, both of which are below investment-grade status, making them high-yield, or “junk” bonds. They are currently rated at B- and Caa1, as Moody’s downgraded Tesla's debt in March citing liquidity concerns.On Thursday, Moody’s said the plan is credit negative, as the company will still need to tap capital markets to fund itself and repay debt, but it will not affect its ratings for now.Tesla bonds should be trading much higher if the bond market was assigning a good chance that the deal would go through with a change of control.In most buyout deals a change of control “is clearly triggered,” as usually a private-equity firm would swoop in and take more than 50% of the company, said Justin Smith, a managing director at Xtract Research, a firm specializing in covenant research.Related: Opinion: Elon Musk takes Tesla on a strange route to a potentially smart idea, yet againTesla bonds are unusual in the debt world, likely reflecting an investor base that includes Tesla fans and admirers, some of whom are not conventional bond investors. That’s one reason they have tended to track the stock. The notes are Tesla’s only pure bonds—the company has issued convertible bonds too—and were sold in August 2017.At the time, many traditional bond investors balked at the lack of compensation for the high risk of a loss-making car maker with unreliable cash flows and for lacking many of the customary bondholder protections.“We never thought this business should be debt financed,” said Bill Zox, chief investment officer at Diamond Hill Capital, a Columbus, Ohio-based investment company. Musk “does strange things with (Tesla),” and the company doesn’t seem the kind of business bond money would finance, he said.Bondholders tend to be tightly focused on an issuer’s financials and especially its cash flows, to be sure that it can and will make its interest payments. That close attention to the balance sheet is one reason the bond market is often considered to be “smarter” than the stock market.“The holders of these bonds are looking at things differently,” Zox said.They were “somewhat irrational” before the going-private talks and after the talks, he said. They seem to be relying on market capitalization to support their positions rather than cash flow, he said.After its initial euphoria, the stock market appeared Thursday to have less confidence in the proposed deal, with Tesla shares down more than 4%.The stock rallied 11% on Tuesday following Musk’s tweets and comments, but are now off around 6% from Tuesday’s $379.57 close. Many are questioning whether funding that would come to tens of billions of dollars and easily dwarf previous buyouts was lined up as firmly as Musk suggested in his tweets.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has inquired about Musk’s first tweet, although it was unclear whether an official investigation had been opened, according to a report on The Wall Street Journal that cited unnamed sources.Musk has indicated that he did not expect that his Tesla ownership stake of around 20% would change following the take-private deal, “suggesting any shares tendered for $420 in cash need to be replaced by a new equity holder, i.e. a strategic acquirer offering to buy a large number of outstanding shares, as opposed to Tesla raising new equity or issuing debt to buy out shares,” analysts at Bernstein said in a note Wednesday.“The question then is, who would be willing to buy TSLA shares at $420, when the stock has never traded at such a level, and was trading ~$300 a week ago? Clearly someone who wants a majority (or very large) stake,” they said.That would leave only a few deep-pocketed investors worldwide. Recent news reports citing unnamed sources have said that two of the more bountiful coffers that could be involved in the deal, SoftBank Group Corp.  9984, -0.38%   and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund, are not interested.“We believe Tesla will need to secure three to five investors prepared to write multibillion-dollar investments,” analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note Thursday.At $420, Tesla’s enterprise value would be around $72 billion, excluding debt. Estimates vary on how much money would be needed to pull off a deal, with consensus emerging around $40 billion.Tesla shares have gained 13% this year, compared with advances of 7% and 3.4% for the S&P 500 index             SPX, -0.14%          and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

TSLA,08/09/2018 14:21,Investors are overlooking this incredibly valuable part of Tesla’s business,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/investors-are-overlooking-this-part-of-teslas-business-2018-08-09,"ARK believes that analysts may be overlooking Tesla’s largest addressable market — autonomous mobility-as-a-service (MaaS).During its earnings call last week, Tesla TSLA, -4.83%  introduced its Autopilot team for the first time as speakers during the prepared remarks. Based on the information presented by the Autopilot team on the performance characteristics of its in-house chip, we believe Tesla could be ahead of its competitors in the autonomous hardware space — a key element in the MaaS market. However, there were only a few questions from analysts regarding the impact of this technology.ARK estimates that electric vehicle sales will outpace expectations in the next five years, reaching 17 million units sold in 2022, and Tesla will be a market leader. Perhaps more importantly, the autonomous MaaS market, which according to our research should be valued in trillions of dollars today given the massive future cash flows, is nowhere to be seen in most valuation models.The auto market is undergoing a massive transformation as we transition toward autonomous electric vehicles. We estimate that net revenue for autonomous platform providers — those companies that own the software technology stack for autonomous ride-hailing services — should exceed $2 trillion by 2030, roughly equal to our expectations for auto maker revenue at that time. Unlike their auto-manufacturing peers, however, autonomous platform providers should see software-like margins, be less capital-intensive, and enjoy network-effect-driven regional competitive dominance.So, while autonomous platform providers may generate the same revenue as automotive manufacturers, ARK believes these providers will generate six times the operating earnings and consequently will prove to be substantially more valuable. In fact, ARK estimates autonomous platforms will be worth more than the entire $4 trillion global energy sector.While Tesla’s autonomous progress is out of public view because of the way it tests its technology, its massive data library suggests it could have a lead in autonomous driving. While Google, GM and others use fleets of autonomous test vehicles, Tesla is able to leverage its customer fleet to test Autopilot features in shadow mode, by running software in the background with no direct impact on driving, feeding valuable information back to Tesla.Thus, Tesla is not subject to the same regulatory reporting requirements that Google GOOGL, +0.25%GOOG, +0.28%  faces in California, for example, where performance data is made publicly available. Still, it’s fair to assume that Tesla has collected billions of miles of data from its customer fleet, compared to the millions of miles that Google has been able to rack up. Tesla’s fleet size also could provide a more robust system to test features compared to Google’s hundreds of test vehicles.Tesla has developed an autonomous chip that is at least three years ahead of any other automotive manufacturer. Musk explained, “whereas the current NVIDIA NVDA, -0.76%   hardware can do 200 frames a second, this is able to do over 2,000 frames a second and with full redundancy and fail-over.”Tesla is currently using an Nvidia chip with 12 teraflops of performance. A tenfold improvement would suggest Tesla’s chip has roughly 120 teraflops of performance. Nvidia’s Xavier chip, which is currently sampling and likely won’t be installed into vehicles until late 2019, has roughly 30 teraflops of performance.In other words, traditional automakers have committed to a chip with inferior specs, and will likely have to wait for Nvidia’s next autonomous product before they can have a processing system comparable to the system Tesla is testing today.A fully autonomous ride-hailing service would improve Tesla’s margins significantly. Elon Musk has said that a fully autonomous version of Autopilot will be available in 2019. Given Musk’s history of stretch goals, perhaps this will translate into a 2020 or 2021 launch.An enhanced Autopilot package with the ability to self-drive costs $5,000 upfront or $6,000 for customers who choose to wait and buy later. Payment for this feature alone can be thought of as nearly pure profit on every Tesla sold with second-generation autopilot hardware. Tesla has said this hardware set will enable fully autonomous driving through software updates.In addition, once Tesla launches the Tesla Network, its autonomous ride-hailing network, it could collect platform fees, similar to Uber’s model today, from every autonomous ride charged to the consumer. Given a rate of $1 per mile to the end consumer and over 100,000 miles per year per vehicle, Tesla could benefit from $20,000 in high-margin platform fees per car per year.Over a five-year lifetime, a single Model 3 could generate $40,000 in net cash flow. Even investors optimistic about Tesla’s prospects project the Model 3 cash flow at $4,000 and one-time in nature. In effect, each Model 3 sale could generate 10 times more cash flow than investors currently understand.Of course, it’s possible that Tesla fails to create a fully autonomous car. While Tesla believes full autonomy is achievable without LiDAR (a system of lasers that creates a point cloud, or a highly detailed 3-D map, of the car’s surroundings), this has yet to be proven.Tesla also has competition and will likely not be first to market with full autonomy. Waymo is launching its commercial autonomous service this year in Phoenix and likely will be first to market. GM’s       GM, -0.40%       Cruise Automation plans to launch its service next year, perhaps also beating Tesla to the punch. Lastly, Baidu       BIDU, -0.95%       will likely dominate China’s autonomous market, as its project Apollo was chosen as the government’s designated national autonomous driving platform.What we believe gives Tesla an edge is its data set and validation system given by its vast customer fleet. These factors may allow Tesla to create a path planning system that overcomes the shortfall of its LiDAR-deficient sensor set.Given that Elon Musk has a history of making the once-impossible possible, we wouldn’t put it past him.Tasha Keeney is an analyst for ARK’s Industrial Innovation strategy and The 3-D Printing ETF.

TSLA,08/09/2018 14:21,Here’s the lesson Michael Dell can teach Elon Musk about taking a company private,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-lesson-michael-dell-can-teach-elon-musk-about-taking-a-company-private-2018-08-09,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Conversations about Tesla possibly going private don’t go far before an analogy to Dell is brought up.And, on the surface, the analogy seems to support Elon Musk’s claim that the company TSLA, -4.83%  could do better as a private company than as a public one subject to all the short-term pressures of Wall Street.A deeper examination, however, calls that interpretation into question.Dell, you may recall, went private in October 2013, when founder and CEO Michael Dell, along with Silver Lake Partners, a buyout firm, acquired the firm in a deal that valued it at $24.9 billion (according to Reuters). The company returned to the public markets this July in a complex deal that valued the company — now called Dell Technologies DVMT, +0.62% — at more than twice that level—between $61.1 billion and $70.1 billion, according to Dell.Not bad at all, you might think. That works out to an annualized return of 21.5%, versus just 9.7% for the S&P 500 SPX, -0.14%Now put that return in context. Computer hardware makers in particular, and the technology sector generally, also produced impressive returns over this same 4 1/2-year period. Take a look at the accompanying chart, which compares Dell’s return while a private company to a number of roughly comparable exchange-traded funds. Notice that their annualized returns all fall within a fairly narrow range quite close to Dell’s.You might find this surprising, since the case for going private seems so compelling. Without the demands of Wall Street to produce results each quarter that satisfy analysts and an impatient investor community, a company can more strategically invest in long-term growth opportunities. That was an argument often made by Michael Dell in 2013 when taking his company private, as well as by Elon Musk more recently.Compelling as that argument otherwise seems, however, the historical data provides precious little support for it. I reviewed the data in a column published in June, so I will only briefly summarize the data here.A fascinating recent academic study gained access, via tax returns, to the operating performance of more than 300 companies that had gone private between 1995 and 2007. The authors of the study then compared them to a carefully selected sample of similar companies that had remained public. On average over the three years after going private, the private companies performed no better than the public ones.Why might private companies not have outperformed comparable public ones? We can only speculate, of course. But one theory, which traces to a now-famous 1986 article by Michael Jensen, now an emeritus professor at Harvard Business School, is that being a public company imposes a helpful discipline. Without that, he argued, companies might foolishly invest in projects at below the cost of capital.I challenge you to read Jensen’s article and not think about some of the more half-baked projects proposed by Musk.Regardless of the reason why private companies don’t outperform public ones, the data marshaled by this study should give pause to those who believe that Tesla should go private. If you’re investing in Tesla over the long term, therefore, you should think twice before accepting any going-private offer from the company.For more information, including descriptions of the Hulbert Sentiment Indices, go to The Hulbert Financial Digest or email mark@hulbertratings.com.

Weird, risky, playful, cryptic, perhaps ill-advised, maybe even brilliant. His entire approach to life, work and social media in two sentences:Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.Morgan Housel, partner at the Collaborative Fund, tried to explain Musk’s behavior by comparing him to John Boyd, a legend of a fighter pilot who revolutionized his field, but didn’t make a lot of friends in the process. “Rude. Erratic. Disobedient. Impatient” — all words he used to describe Boyd.“He talked back to superiors to the astonishment of his peers, and was once nearly court-martialed for setting ablaze hangars that didn’t have proper heating,” Housel wrote in his piece. “In meetings, he would chew calluses off his hands and spit the dead skin across the table.” Sounds kind of like the bizarre Tesla earnings call with analysts back in May.Still, Boyd was too talented to keep down, as he rose through the ranks and eventually penned the definitive book on fighter maneuvers. “Throughout his career, no one knew what to do with him,” Housel said. “He pissed off a lot of people. He was unique in every way — good, bad, awful, and occasionally illegal.”As for Musk...Shares of #Tesla surged on Tuesday after @elonmusk tweeted that the company may be taken private. Today, the stock is getting hammered. Ho hum... Just another week in the life of Tesla investors.A post shared by MarketWatch (@marketwatch) on Aug 9, 2018 at 10:42am PDT“What kind of 32-year-old thinks they can take on GM  GM, -0.40%   , Ford  F, -1.39%  and NASA at the same time? A freakin’ maniac,” Housel explained. “The kind of person who thinks normal constraints don’t apply to them — not in an egotistical way, but in a genuine, believe-it-in-your-bones way.”That brings us to a chart plucked from Brian Portnoy’s book, “The Geometry of Wealth,” which applies nicely to Musk and investors betting on his next move. Basically, the bigger the risk, the bigger the potential reward/downside. But, as you can see, Portnoy contends the relationship is not linear:“Some people are natural maniacs,” Housel said. “You can’t ask for the maniac parts you like without realizing there are maniac parts that might backfire.”We’ll see if Musk’s tweet ultimately backfires. As it stands now, even the Wall Street pros are scratching their heads. “Frankly, we’re as confused as anyone else,” Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.The stock got a huge initial lift, but is drifting lower on Thursday after it came to light that regulators are taking a look at the tweet.Shawn Langlois is an editor and writer for MarketWatch in Los Angeles.

TSLA, -4.83%  .Musk’s tweet on Tuesday proposed returning Tesla, the electronic car company, to private ownership to give shareholders, especially his employee shareholders, a chance to avoid stock price volatility that “can be a major distraction” and allow the company maintain its focus on long-term goals. Also, as the “most shorted stock in the history of the stock market,” Musk believes many people have an incentive to “attack” the company, attacks Musk has responded to in a way critics and short-sellers say is not appropriate for a public company CEO.He told Tesla employees in an email shortly afterward, “I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%). My hope is for all shareholders to remain, but if they prefer to be bought out, then this would enable that to happen at a nice premium.”See also: Elon Musk explained his going-private tweet to Tesla employees with this emailIn a follow-on tweet, he explained that his “hope” is that all current investors would remain Tesla shareholders even if its private would be accomplished by creating a “special purpose fund” as he said he and executives of his other private company private do with ”Fidelity’s investment in SpaceX.”See also: Tesla’s going-private proposal has analysts ‘as confused as anyone else’Back in January of 2013, Musk responded to a growing push by SpaceX employees for that company to go public by saying that Tesla, and its subsidiary SolarCity, had IPOd “because they didn’t have any choice. Their private capital structure was becoming unwieldy and they needed to raise a lot of equity capital.”Musk is now using the same reasons for Tesla going private as he cited to the SpaceX employees.A deal to go private again would be structured like SpaceX, he told employees in an email. All Tesla employees would remain shareholders, just like at SpaceX, and external and employee shareholders would have an opportunity to sell or buy shares approximately every six months.“Some at SpaceX who have not been through a public company experience may think that being public is desirable,” Musk wrote in 2013. “This is not so. Public company stocks, particularly if big step changes in technology are involved, go through extreme volatility, both for reasons of internal execution and for reasons that have nothing to do with anything except the economy. This causes people to be distracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of creating great products.”See also: The revenue-growth rate that helped fuel Tesla’s rally relied on an apples-to-oranges comparisonRead: Tesla says it did not ask suppliers for cash backJohn Coates, a professor of law and economics at Harvard Law School, told MarketWatch in an email, “I know of no legal way to offer public shareholders of a listed company an equity security while also going private. I also know of no legal way to offer $X billion worth securities of any kind to more than 35 unaccredited investors without registering with the SEC.”There are now some opportunities for smaller offerings of securities, $5 million or less in any 12-month period, but those are restricted to 35 retail investors or less.Securities laws require companies to go public via a traditional full initial public offering registered with the SEC if they have more than $10 million in total assets and a class of equity securities, like common stock, that is held of record by either 2,000 or more persons or 500 or more persons who are not accredited investors.These requirements are intended partly to avoid an unequal distribution of information between potential retail investors and large accredited investors when a company is private and no public disclosure is required.Tesla has 169.8 million shares outstanding but only 126.9 million in public float, that is, shares that are actually available for trading. Approximately 25.3 % of its shares are held by insiders, including Elon Musk who holds 37.9 million shares or 21.9% of the outstanding shares as of the date of the company’s last proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.As of Dec. 31, Tesla, Inc. had 37,543 full-time employees, most who hold Tesla shares.Public company status and listing on an exchange also avoids the complicated private accounting for shareholder interests that develops when companies have thousands of investors of very different sizes and financial sophistication. Musk may be thinking of the structure used by traditional venture capital funds for angel investors to primarily invest in early stage investments, set up as a pooled investment vehicle in a limited partnership or limited liability company, an LP or LLC. This structure enables a group of investors, usually individuals, to invest collectively.“The closest I could imagine to what seems to be Musk’s idea is to create a new hedge or private equity fund, limited to accredited investors, offering limited partner interests in exchange for Tesla stock,” said Coates, “and, then, for a combination of large direct investors to buy stock from Tesla and then in some fashion cash out the remaining public investors.”“A mutual fund could possibly also invest in the ongoing company, which would allow unaccredited investors an ability to invest indirectly in it,” Coates added. “But the fund would have to live with diversification requirements that would make it not only an indirect but also a diluted form of Tesla ownership.”Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

Several board members on Wednesday confirmed that Tesla had raised the idea a week ago, but did not indicate whether they were in favor.“Frankly, we’re as confused as anyone else,” analysts at Bernstein said in a note, going on to line up eight questions around Musk’s wish to take Tesla private at $420 a share while offering few details on how to go about it.Read more: Tesla short sellers walloped after Musk talks going privateFor the shares, there’s upside risk in the near term to perhaps $400, but downside risk to $340, Tuesday’s low, or below “if no firmer details emerge, as investors would likely increasingly debate Musk’s credibility and over-focus on the shares’ price and volatility,” the Bernstein analysts said.Tesla shares fell 1.4% Wednesday, trading as low as $367.12, after ending at $379.57 Tuesday, an 11% advance and their highest since a Sept. 18 record high of $385.The Bernstein analysts said they got confirmation from Tesla’s investor relations that Musk’s talk about financing was correct.Tesla’s enterprise value hovers around $80 billion, and estimates on how much Tesla would need in financing to cinch the deal varied and depended on assumptions on whether a significant number of investors would not tender their shares, as Musk seemed to indicate when he mentioned having investor support.Musk has a 20% stake, around $13 billion, which he said would remain the same.Whoever steps in to buy Tesla at $420, when the stock traded around $300 last week, would be “clearly someone who wants a majority (or a very large stake),” which leaves only a few pockets deep enough, including Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund, which reportedly took a stake in Tesla this week but according to a report on The Wall Street Journal had no plans to expand it.Musk and Softbank Group Corp. 9984, -0.38%  Chief Executive Masayoshi Son held talks last year, including about potentially taking the car maker private, but the discussions fell through “due to disagreements over ownership,” according to a Bloomberg News report that cited two people with knowledge of the discussions.Analysts at Evercore ISI also zeroed in the lack of details around “funding secured.”See also: Elon Musk explained his going-private tweet to Tesla employees with this emailA “possible scenario” would be 50% to 60% of existing shareholders, including Musk’s 20% holdings, continue, “with their holdings rolled into a new private structure,” the Evercore ISI analysts said.That would leave Tesla needing to raise equity capital of $31 billion to $39 billion to buy out those existing public shareholders who tender; 40% to 50% of Tesla’s implied $78 billion market value, and assuming debt is rolled, they said.Related: Call of the day: Tesla shares are headed for $420 regardlessThe more likely route to that $31 billion-$39 billion would be a combination of a strategic investor, two to three private investment firms or sovereign-wealth funds, and “certain larger members of the existing shareholder base or some form of fund for smaller accredited investors making up the delta,” they said.Aside from not having to answer to markets in the short term, as Musk pointed out in his email, the Evercore ISI saw one advantage of going private —it could provide Tesla with deeper pockets to grow internationally at a faster rate, and security through the next U.S./capital markets recession where public funding would dry up, they said.Analysts at J.P. Morgan raised their price target on Tesla on Wednesday to $308 from a previous $195, then one of the lowest among major investment banks. They are “not as certain” as Musk that Tesla will go private, so assigned a 50% probability to the scenario in their updated valuation.See also: Tesla bonds jump more than 2 points after CEO Musk mulls going-private transaction“We continue to believe Tesla’s valuation based on fundamentals alone ... is worth no more than $195,” the analysts said. “But introducing a new 50% weighting of $420 suggests a large upward revision to our price target is warranted, and we newly value Tesla at $308 per share (i.e., 50/50 blend of $195 and $420).”Analysts at Goldman Sachs recalled Dell’s $25 billion buyout in 2013, only to reject that as a perfect case study for Tesla.“While the transaction was somewhat similar in nature to what is being proposed at TSLA, the EBITDA generation and cash flow characteristics of the business were very different given a more mature product and growth profile,” the analysts said. Dell’s reported 2013 adjusted EBITDA was $5.1 billion, and free cash flow generation was about $3 billion.Tesla’s free cash flow was a negative $739 million in its latest quarter.Goldman kept its sell rating and six-month price target on Tesla at $210, also one of the lowest on the Street.Piper Jaffray analysts assigned a low likelihood the deal would come to pass.Tesla would not be going private “anytime soon,” they said, as many details remain “unknowable” and as result “the deal is unlikely to succeed in the very near-term, if it succeeds at all,” the analysts said.For the “true believers with a multi-year time horizon,” the suggested go-private valuation would be “unpalatable,” and gaining shareholder approval would be easier than gaining funding, the analysts said.Tesla shares rose 20% this year, compared with gains of 7% and 3.6% for the S&P 500 index                          SPX, -0.14%                   and Dow Jones Industrial Average.

TSLA,08/08/18,SEC questions Tesla over Elon Musk’s tweets to take the company private,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sec-questions-tesla-over-elon-musks-tweets-to-take-the-company-private-2018-08-08,"WASHINGTON — Securities regulators have inquired with Tesla Inc. about Chief Executive Elon Musk’s surprise announcement that he may take the company private and whether his claim was factual, people familiar with the matter said.The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked whether Musk’s unusual announcement on Tuesday was factual, the people said. The regulator also asked Tesla TSLA, -4.83%   about why the disclosure was made on Twitter rather than in a regulatory filing, and whether the company believes the announcement complies with investor-protection rules, the people said.Read: Musk’s plan to take Tesla private while allowing outside shareholders would prove cumbersomeMusk on Tuesday proposed taking Tesla private at $420 a share, about 11% higher than the day’s closing stock price. He called the funding “secured” for what would be the biggest-ever corporate buyout, but he hasn’t disclosed details. A group of Tesla board members on Wednesday said Musk spoke to them last week about taking the company private.The SEC’s inquiries, which originated from its San Francisco office, suggest Tesla could come under an enforcement investigation if regulators develop evidence that Musk’s statement was misleading or false. It wasn’t immediately clear on Wednesday whether the regulator had opened a formal enforcement investigation based on the answers it received from the company. An SEC spokesman declined to comment.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.Also popular on WSJ.com:On U.S. planes, the dogs are winning.N.Y.

Then the CEO released a blog post expanding on his deliberations, which you can read here. On Wednesday, the shares fell about 2%.What to do now? Let us explore the legal inside information that can help you trade Tesla if you desire to do so.Please click here for the annotated chart of Tesla TSLA, -4.83% Note the following from the chart:• The chart shows the VUD indicator. This is the most sensitive indicator of net supply and demand in real time. The indicator is positive but less than would have been expected. The interpretation is two-fold. First, there are not many believers in the transaction actually happening. Second, short-sellers, who bet on a decline in the share price, have not covered their positions during this rise.• Based on the latest information available, 29% of shares outstanding have been sold short. In our analysis, the actual number is likely higher.• If a short squeeze starts, meaning short-sellers would have to cover their positions by buying the stock, the stock could rocket toward $420 long before any transaction is finalized.• There obviously is high risk in buying the stock now. The chart shows support points. Stops can be put below these support points.• It is advisable to put stops in tranches. We are providing to The Arora Report subscribers the exact size of tranches and stop zones.• Since the stock can be halted or gap down on the next day, stop loss orders may not protect you. For this reason, stops should be only your second line of defense. The first line of defense is the position size. Another way to protect yourself is to buy put options. However, this may not be practical for many given the high cost of put options. One way to reduce the cost of put options is to buy put spreads.• The overall risk-reward in this trade is attractive, but this is suitable only for aggressive investors as the risk of loss is high.Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies.

TSLA,08/08/18,Tesla board statement raises more questions about Elon Musk’s go-private plan,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-board-statement-raises-more-questions-about-elon-musks-go-private-plan-2018-08-08,"A statement from Tesla’s board members on Wednesday raises further questions following the shock tweet from Elon Musk that he wants to take the auto maker private.The brief news release from Tesla board members—Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Linda Johnson Rice, and James Murdoch—consisted of three sentences:Two board members, venture capital investor Steve Jurvetson as well as Musk’s brother, Kimbal Musk, didn’t sign on to the statement. (Jurvetson has taken leave from Tesla after being accused of sexual harassment.)The statement from members of Tesla Inc.’s TSLA, -4.83% board does show there was a discussion of how he could fund such a bid. But the board’s statement leaves open the crucial question of whether they were satisfied that—as Musk’s surprise tweet put it—he had enough backing to assert “funding secured.”At $420 a share, the price at which Musk tweeted he was considering setting the bid, the deal would be valued at $72 billion before debt.Related: A Tesla buyout would be the largest in history—by a wide marginTesla shares were down more than 1% early Wednesday, after surging by about 11% on Tuesday. The electric-car maker’s stock has climbed by 21% so far this year. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.29%   is set for a year-to-date gain of 3.5%, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.14%   is on track for a return of 6.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.04%   has advanced by more than 14% so far this year, according to FactSet data. Tesla’s run-up comes despite the company being a consistent target of investors aiming to short the its stock, or bet against Tesla’s shares rising.Another crucial question raised by the statement is the timing. “Last week” predates Tesla’s filing on Monday of its 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which didn’t mention such discussions.News of a takeover would certainly be considered material, yet it wasn’t disclosed until Musk’s tweet on Tuesday.Another question is what the “appropriate next steps” are, though that’s probably the imminent formation of a committee to evaluate the bid.What was left out of the statement also is worth considering. For instance, there was no indication that the board was satisfied with either Musk’s method or timing for announcing the approach, though they didn’t rebuke him, either.Murdoch also sits on the board of News Corp., which owns MarketWatch, the publisher of this report.Related: Did Elon Musk break any laws with his going-private tweet?Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

TSLA,08/08/18,Tesla: Is $420 a Share Too Low for a Deal?,https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-is-420-a-share-too-low-for-a-deal-1533737967,"There are plenty of things one might wonder about yesterday’s revelations that Elon Musk is “considering” taking Tesla (TSLA) private—among them, how a deal might be funded and structured and, of course…was Musk making a pot joke?Some have wondered whether the Muskian tweet that started all this might lead to regulatory trouble. And then there’s the question: Is $420 a share even enough? At least one analyst—who, it should be noted, is among the Street’s more optimistic regarding the Barron’s Next 50 company’s shares—thinks it isn’t.“We do not think Tesla shareholders view the $420 per share mark as an adequate premium for a go-private transaction, and therefore we think investors could look for a higher price,” Baird’s Ben Kallo wrote Wednesday, citing “recent conversations with investors.”“We think shareholders will demand a higher price for a potential go-private transaction, which could cause shares to trade above $420, particularly as shorts may cover positions,” according to Kallo. “We expect the stock to move higher as the story develops.”Baird, which currently has a $411 price target on Tesla’s shares, isn’t the most-bullish analyst tracked by FactSet. Its price target is 9% above current levels and roughly 28% over FactSet’s mean around $322; some analysts are at or above $500.Barron’s has examined the latest Tesla news from a range of perspectives. Andrew Bary suggested caution for investors looking to play the arbitrage game. Ben Levisohn offered reasons why going private would appeal to Musk. Randall Forsythe examined the company’s convertible bonds.Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock—currently up about 17% in 2018—was quiet Wednesday morning after a busy Tuesday. Will investors, as Baird suggests, push for a bigger premium?The company’s board issued a broad statement Wednesday, saying that recent conversations have touched on strategic and financial questions regarding a deal—though major details, generally speaking, haven’t been disclosed (or otherwise filtered out).Meanwhile, other analysts were wary. The more bearish JP Morgan, for example, raised its price target but kept it below current levels, figuring that a 50% chance of a deal as currently understood “suggests a large upward revision to our price target is warranted.”“As surprising to us as these developments are, and as lacking as the statements are in any details regarding who is expected to provide the required amount of financing and on what terms, they are nevertheless declarative statements from the CEO of a public company which we feel should be considered seriously,” JP Morgan wrote.Email David Marino-Nachison at david.marino-nachison@barrons.com.
