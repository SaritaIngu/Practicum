TSLA,07/31/2018 21:59,"Tesla shareholders, buckle up — given how Elon Musk is driving the company",http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-shareholders-should-buckle-up-given-how-elon-musk-is-driving-the-company-2018-07-31,"Here’s a big question I’d be asking if I owned Tesla stock: What happened to 345,000 reservations?When Tesla’s Model 3 was released, it was supposed to be a $35,000 car. Four hundred thousand people, including yours truly, put down a $1,000 deposit to reserve their spots in line so they could get their hands on that marvel as soon as it became available. It was a brilliant move by Tesla TSLA, +2.75%  , as it provided the company $400 million of interest-free financing — the biggest crowdfunding project ever.Today, after some delays, the Model 3 is being produced. However, $35,000 seems to have been a fiction of CEO Elon Musk’s imagination. Though the car is getting great reviews from auto critics, the price for a bare-bones Model 3 starts at $49,000, and the tax incentives are fading away.But something interesting happened recently. I received an email from Tesla that said: Model 3 is available to order, and no reservation is required in the U.S. We’re now offering all our best options — including our Long Range and Performance configurations with dual motor all-wheel drive. You can design and order yours today for delivery in approximately 2–4 months.On the surface this sounds like great news, except that it begs a question: What happened to 345,000 orders? Let me explain. According to Bloomberg, which has been tracking Tesla’s production, to date (as of July 28, 2018) Tesla has produced 55,000 Model 3 cars. Since a $1,000 deposit was supposed to secure buyers a place in line, any car ordered today will only be delivered after orders that were placed years ago are fulfilled — after all, 400,000 people paid Tesla $1,000 to hold their places.Thus there are only three possible explanations for the email I received. One is that Model 3 production is expected to accelerate at an exponential rate to 40,000 cars a week, starting now. However, Bloomberg estimates that Tesla’s normal production cadence of the Model 3 is closer to 2,825 cars a week, so this is a highly unlikely scenario.Or two, maybe Tesla has been extremely liberal with its statement of a two-to-four month delivery schedule because it still has 345,000 cars to produce before it can start fulfilling new orders, and the company is using that email to raise additional funds from new customers making deposits. (The required deposit is now $2,500.)There is a third explanation: The bulk of the original 400,000 orders were for a $35,000 car. When it came time to actually buy the car, consumers may have realized that the out-of-pocket expense was much more than expected and simply canceled their orders, draining Telsa’s balance sheet of $345 million.This brings us to the next question: How sound is Tesla’s balance sheet?What Musk has achieved with Tesla and SpaceX is truly astounding. I have incredible respect for him, but he is also a magician playing a confidence game. If Musk can continue to convince the market that Tesla has a bright future, then the market will continue to finance Tesla’s losses, and maybe Musk will figure out how to produce the Model 3 more cheaply and then Tesla will sell hundreds of thousands of Model 3s and the future will be as bright as Musk paints it.For that to happen, Tesla needs to maintain its high stock price, and investors have to believe that Musk is the Iron Man. Investors have to suspend belief, ignore current problems, and focus on the future. However, if the market loses confidence in Tesla and Musk, Tesla is done. This company is losing billions of dollars a year; it has an over-levered balance sheet. This is where Musk’s confidence game comes in.If you believe in magic stop reading right now. Okay, you’ve been warned.There is no magic. Magic is just the art of misdirection. The magician gets you to focus on the shiny object he holds in his left hand and you don’t see what he is doing with his right hand.Musk has been showing us a lot of shiny objects. Some are real, like the success of SpaceX; some are superfluous, like sending a Tesla Roadster into space, and some are future promises on which Musk may or may not be able to deliver, like his futuristic underground railroad for cars (the hyperloop) and the Tesla truck, which is unlikely to be produced on time and at the promised price. The list is long in this category and never-ending; Musk’s futuristic thinking knows no bounds.But importantly, these promises are the shiny objects that keep Tesla’s stock price high.If I was a Tesla investor I’d be seriously worried about the company’s balance sheet. There are some ominous signs that Tesla’s financial situation is deteriorating rapidly. Tesla reportedly recently sent an email to its suppliers asking them to give some money back to help the company with its profitability.Such requests are made by companies looking for Hail Mary solutions to significant financial problems. If suppliers start questioning Tesla’s financial viability, they’ll start shortening their accounts receivables periods and start requesting letters of credit. This would escalate the company’s problems. Hail Marys are acts of desperation. Putting this in the context of the likely Model 3 cancellations, — Tesla’s cash burn has likely gotten a lot worse.Read: Tesla says it did not ask suppliers for cash backThis brings us to the last question: How effective is Musk at running Tesla?Tesla is Elon Musk. He has achieved more than many of us will achieve in a thousand lifetimes. But today Musk is running half a dozen companies (Tesla, SpaceX, Solar City, Boring, OpenAI, Hyperloop). To make matters worse, he is also an incredible micromanager. I read that he interviews (or at least used to) every new employee who joins Tesla and SpaceX.It is clear that Musk is quite exhausted, and his behavior is becoming more erratic. In a conference call snafu in April, he called the British diver who saved the Thai cave kids a “pedo” on Twitter. This sort of thing undermines Musk’s Iron Man image — if he loses that, the confidence game is lost and Tesla is done.Read: UBS, Goldman see Tesla shares falling 30%, keep bearish stance on stock ahead of company resultsAnother red flag went up recently: Musk started to attack short sellers. A short seller who went under the name of Montana Sceptic posted negative research on Tesla on Twitter and SeekingAlpha. Elon Musk personally called the man’s employer and threatened a lawsuit if the employer didn’t silence Montana Sceptic. Historically, companies that have gone after short sellers have had something to hide or were playing a confidence game. (The short sellers were interfering with the misdirection to shiny objects.)Read: Tesla earnings: Gear up for more drama after Model 3 production burstTesla investors are still fascinated by the shiny objects, but I note that CDS insurance on Tesla’s bonds prices in a 24% risk of default by 2025. I am not long or short the stock. But if I were long Tesla’s shares I’d be asking myself these questions. After all, you’re paying $50 billion for a company that trades completely on the spoils of future dreams.So, how does one invest in this overvalued stock market?

But he said the company is focused on reaching a “more sustainable” long-term cost basis with suppliers, including pushing for future cost reductions.The Wall Street Journal reported late on Sunday that some suppliers had been asked to rebate payments going back to 2016, sending Tesla shares down 5% in early trading on Monday.Tesla  TSLA, +2.75%  shares have lost 2.7% so far this year, and more than 7% in the past 12 months, which contrasts with S&P 500 index’s   SPX, +0.49%  gains of more than 5% for the year and 13% in the last 12 months.“Negotiation is a standard part of the procurement process, and now that we’re in a stronger position with Model 3 production ramping, it is a good time to improve our competitive advantage in this area,” the spokesman said in emailed comments.“We’re focused on reaching a more sustainable long term cost basis, not just finding one-time reductions for this quarter, and that’s good for Tesla, our shareholders, and our suppliers who will also benefit from our increasing production volume and future growth opportunities.”Any changes with suppliers would improve Tesla’s future cash flows “but not impact our ability to achieve profitability in Q3,” said the spokesman. Discussions with suppliers are focused entirely on future parts price and design or process changes, he said, intended to lower costs in the future rather than make prior period adjustments of capital expenditure projects, according to the spokesman.Tesla shares were down 3.5% in late Monday trade.Francine McKenna is a MarketWatch reporter based in Washington, covering financial regulation and legislation from a transparency perspective.

The solar-power company, which popularized the leasing of residential solar-power systems, was founded by two of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk’s cousins. The acquisition has had its fair share of detractors, with the accompanying lawsuits to challenge it, mostly alleging breach of fiduciary duty by Tesla.The San Diego plaintiffs said they took their concerns to management, including to Musk, but instead they were fired in late May 2017, according to a copy of the lawsuit published by Ars Technica.They are also suing the companies for failure to pay overtime, failure to provide work breaks, and other work-related complaints. In addition, one of the men alleges he was sexually harassed due to his sexual orientation, and the other man alleges that age discrimination was behind his firing.See also: Tesla earnings: Gear up for more drama after Model 3 production burstBoth sides are scheduled to meet with Superior Court Judge Gregory Pollack on Dec. 28.A Tesla spokesperson said Tuesday the plaintiffs’ roles were eliminated last year as part of the Tesla-SolarCity integration, when Tesla decided to end door-to-door sales of energy products. The suggestion they were eliminated for any other reason “is false,” the company said in an e-mailed statement.The allegations of false sales records were investigated and found to be inaccurate, Tesla said.“To be clear, we have seen absolutely nothing that suggests there were ‘fake potential sales accounts’ as claimed in the lawsuit,” the company said. Other allegations in the suit were unsubstantiated.“Tesla is absolutely against any form of discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment of any kind by or against anyone, and we take any concerns raised by employees very seriously, as we did here. In this case, the facts simply don’t support the plaintiffs’ story,” the company said.Tesla shares rose 1.9% on Tuesday, a day before the company is scheduled to report second-quarter results.

At long last, this trend may be unraveling.Value-based strategies could be poised for a comeback, as the overall economic environment becomes more challenging, with rising interest rates and a less-certain growth outlook. At the same time, the advance in growth-based plays is seen as overdone, as highlighted by recent implosions in some of the strategy’s biggest outperformers, including Facebook and Netflix.“We think the turn is in,” wrote Morgan Stanley in a Monday note to clients, saying that the “almost unprecedented” degree of outperformance by growth over value was poised to shift.Don’t miss: Prepare for the biggest stock-market selloff in months, Morgan Stanley warnsThus far this year, the S&P 500 Growth index SP500G, +0.68%  is up 10.8%, a move that is more than twice the 4.8% gain of the overall S&P 500 SPX, +0.49% Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Value index SP500V, +0.27% is down 0.2% thus far this year.This trend has held across market capitalization sizes. The Russell 1000 Value index RLV, +0.36%  is up 0.4% thus far in 2018, below the overall Russell 1000 RUI, +0.53% (up 4.7%) and the Russell 1000 Growth index RLG, +0.70%  (up 8.8%). The Russell 2000 index RUT, +1.07%  of small-capitalization shares is up 7.7%—the Russell 2000 Growth index RUO, +1.39%  is up 9.7% while its value index RUJ, +0.75%  is up 5.4%.This is hardly new to 2018. Value has been such an underperformer for years—not only relative to growth, but also to the broader market—that last year Goldman Sachs asked whether markets had seen “the death of value.” The investment bank was just one in a chorus of voices sounding the alarm; Jeremy Grantham, the founder of asset manager GMO, suggested that many of the mostly widely used metrics in evaluating undervalued companies no longer held much weight for stock moves.The following FactSet chart looks at the 10-year performance of the S&P 500 growth index (in green), and compares it with both the unadjusted index (red) and the value index (blue). The chart illustrates that growth has consistently, and significantly outperformed over the past decade.“We appreciate the fact that fighting momentum can be a losing game but when things get this extreme and there is evidence of a turn, we have to go the other way,” Morgan Stanley wrote.While growth has done better for years, the degree to which it has been outperforming value has been unusually high of late. According to the investment bank, the difference hasn’t been this extreme since the dot-com era.Furthermore, the valuation difference between the large-cap growth stocks and their value equivalents is also at its most extreme since 2006. According to FactSet, the Russell 1000 growth index has a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.21, compared with the 17.98 ratio of the value index.While growth overall has benefited from an environment with low interest rates and steady economic expansion since the financial crisis, it has particularly benefited as some of the market’s biggest names have been growth plays. In particular, the FAANG group of stocks, which refers to Facebook FB, +0.89% Amazon.com AMZN, -0.10% Apple AAPL, +0.20% Netflix NFLX, +0.74% and Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL, -0.23%GOOG, -0.20% are all high-growth stocks.Related: Why investors shouldn’t sweat the stock market’s reliance on FAANG sharesWhile that group has led the market for years, including in 2018, the rally has recently shown signs of cracks. Both Netflix and Facebook tumbled after their most recent quarterly report, with Facebook suffering its biggest one-day drop ever and dropping into bear-market territory.Facebook’s plummet resulted in a rare week of pronounced outperformance by value instead of growth last week. The S&P 500 value index gained 1.44% over last week, compared with the 0.6% rise of the index overall. The growth index dropped 0.1%. That represented the biggest weekly outperformance by value over growth since December, according to the WSJ Market Data Group.“Whether this is a blip or the start of something new, where investors rotate into value in an earnest way, remains to be seen,” said Michael Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners. “However, the current environment feels a bit like the dot-com era, which was the last time that tech valuations in particular got a little stretched. When those pulled back, that led to a period of value outperformance that lasted for years.”Morgan Stanley espoused this view, saying that the outperformance of growth strategies wasn’t justified by past and forecast earnings growth.“Based on this spread widening over the past year, we think it time for a reversal. Either large-cap value stocks will go up more or large-cap growth stocks will simply come down and catch up with the rest of the market on P/E compression,” it wrote. “We think it will be the latter but would not care if it is the former. Either way Value outperforms Growth and we think the spread can narrow by 10-15% over the next several months.”Morgan Stanley analysts referred to the outperformance by the value contingent last week as “a good start.”Ryan Vlastelica is a markets reporter for MarketWatch and is based in New York.

But they also represent a considerable risk for the typical index-fund investor because the S&P 500 and the index funds that track it are weighted by market capitalization.But there is a different index approach that provides just as much diversification while limiting the risk of taking a brutal hit in one area of the market: equal-weighted index funds.One example is the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP, +0.68% As its name implies, this ETF holds the S&P 500 companies in equal proportions. The ETF has a four-star rating (out of five) from fund-research firm Morningstar and has an annual expense ratio of only 0.20%.

Twitch has viewership numbers that dwarf the combined viewership of HBO, Netflix NFLX, +0.74%  and ESPN.During the past two years, videogame publishers have finally wised up on how to make more money from this trend. They’ve formed competitive leagues modeled after the major sports leagues, complete with team owners, paid players and ties to big cities.Here are the two big ones, launched in the past 18 months.• Riot Games, a Los Angeles-based division of China’s Tencent Holdings TCEHY, -0.65%0700, -0.28% founded the League of Legends Championship Series. It’s based on the popular League of Legends game from Riot.• Blizzard Entertainment, a division of Activision-Blizzard ATVI, +0.92% launched the Overwatch League, a professional esports franchise based on its hugely popular game Overwatch.These leagues already drew big crowds on Twitch and platforms in Asia like Douyu and HuyaHUYA, -0.49%  . But the July 27-28 ESPN prime-time broadcast of the Overwatch League finals is an important step in establishing esports as part of mainstream popular media, says Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak. The broadcast is part of a multiyear agreement between ESPN and Blizzard Entertainment for live television coverage of the Overwatch League.What exactly is esports? NewZoo, a research group, sums up the difference from regular online videogame play in that there is an organized league, a tournament with a specific goal like winning a champion title, and paid professional athletes.And yes, this really is a sport. Sort of. It might not require the physical prowess needed to play pro basketball. But esports teams train for up to eight hours a day. They have coaches and nutritionists on staff. And they get a regular salary. About 50 colleges have varsity esports teams, and esports may be part of the 2024 Olympics.The key here is that the two leagues set up the infrastructure needed to make money from esports events, even if the initial money from broadcasting deals is small. Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher Merwin puts ESPN payments to Activision-Blizzard at $10 million to $20 million a year. That’s less than the estimated $45 million a year that Activision-Blizzard gets from a two-year distribution deal with Twitch. But in investing, it’s the medium term that matters, and the potential is big.Read: Meg Whitman invests in esports company ImmortalsThe League of Legends world finals last year attracted 58 million viewers, according to Riot Games, which publishes this game. That’s already a lot bigger than the World Series (38 million), the NBA finals (32 million), and the Stanley Cup finals (11 million), notes Goldman’s Merwin.But this is just the beginning. Drawing on research from NewZoo, Merwin thinks the global monthly audience for esports will reach 167 million this year, larger than the draw of Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League.“By 2022, we estimate the esports audience will reach 276 million, similar in size to the NFL today,” he says.There is plenty of room for growth in part because esports is going mainstream. But there’s also a lot of room for growth from the inside, since only 15% of gamers say they have watched an esports competition, says Mintel, a consumer research group.Advertisers love esports because it gives them access to younger people, who are notorious cord-cutters with cable television. About 80% of the esports audience is under 35.T-Mobile U.S. TMUS, +0.30% has partnered with the Overwatch League and teams to create branded content and offer discounts. PepsiCo PEP, +0.72%  and Turtle Wax have sponsored esports teams. Videogame publishers also make money by selling media rights.Merwin thinks esports revenue will hit $3 billion by 2022, from $655 million last year. This will be a big deal for videogame publishers. Merwin thinks esports will contribute 38 cents a share in annual earnings at Activision by 2023. For context, the company averaged 98 cents a share in annual earnings during the past five years. And that 38 cents a share could translate to almost $9 on the share price, assuming a price-earnings multiple of 23. Activision recently traded for about $78.What will continue to drive all of this growth? Mainstreaming, thanks to ESPN, will be a big factor in attracting a fresh wave of interest in videogames. Here are four others factors.Jeff Reeves: 7 stocks that will get you into the esports phenomenonHighly popular videogames like Fortnite, which has more than 125 million players in part because anyone can play for free, will continue to draw new faces into the space. This will support esports growth. Other popular titles attracting newcomers include PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, Dungeon Fighter Online, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto and Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) games.Read: How ‘Fortnite’ cracked the code to become the most successful free videogame everFortnite publisher Epic Games recently offered $100 million in prize money for Fortnite esports tournaments. That’s nearly the size of the entire esports prize pool in 2017. This will attract more fans.Also: Want to make money off the ‘Fortnite’ video game? Buy this stockCompetitive gaming on mobile — as oppose to PCs — is big in Asia. Analysts question whether esports and videogame play will make the same crossover in the West. But Asia often sets the trends in video gaming, so it might.Wherever there are sports, you will find gamblers. And esports will be no exception. International Data Corporation estimates that at least $250 million will be wagered legally on esports events this year. That’s small. But two factors suggest decent growth — and spillover effects — ahead.One is that Las Vegas is trying to move into this area, partly as a way to attract millennials to gaming, says GAMCO Investors gaming analyst Adam Trivison. Luxor Hotel & Casino has set up an esports arena that Trivison describes as impressive.The other is the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992. This clears the way for states to set up sports gambling venues — including venues dedicated to esports.Sports gambling is a low-margin business, says Trivison. It’s more of a way for casinos to draw crowds.It will do the same thing for esports.Now read: Esports are here to stay, but who is poised to make a killing?Michael Brush is a Manhattan-based financial writer.

AAPL,08/01/2018 00:22,"Apple earnings show why you can expect more $1,000 iPhones",http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-earnings-show-why-you-can-expect-more-1000-iphones-2018-07-31,"Apple Inc.’s expensive iPhone X helped the company beat Wall Street’s expectations yet again this quarter, giving credence to the possibility of another higher-priced iPhone this fall.Apple AAPL, +0.20%  reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results Thursday, sending its stock toward record highs in after-hours trading. But Apple’s revenue beat came from higher prices of iPhones, even as the number of units came in below expectations and knocked Apple into a spot it hasn’t seen in eight years.Apple said it sold 41.3 million iPhones in the quarter ended July 31, down 21% from the previous quarter and up 1% from the year-ago period. Apple sold about 500,000 fewer iPhones than Wall Street was expecting. On the conference call with analysts, Apple’s Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the average selling price for an iPhone was $724 in the quarter, compared with analysts’ consensus of $693, thanks to a mix of variables that favored Apple’s higher-priced smartphones.“IPhone revenue grew 20% year-over-year with iPhone ASP increasing to $724 from $606 a year ago, driven by the strong performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus across the world,” Maestri said.Read more about Apple’s earnings in the MarketWatch live blogApple’s top-of-the-line iPhone, the iPhone X, starts at $999, but the company now offers more models than ever before, including the cheaper iPhone SE. Before Tuesday’s earnings, analysts had predicted Apple’s iPhone ASPs for fiscal 2018 at $705, according to FactSet, an estimate that will likely rise in the coming days.Apple will need that extra cash if competitors continue to gain ground. As Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was discussing earnings on a conference call Tuesday, IDC released data on the global smartphone market that showed Apple was knocked down to the No. 3 player in the world. Apple, which had been one of the top two smartphone manufacturers continually since the second quarter of 2010, was leapfrogged by Huawei Technologies Co. of China, while Samsung Electronics Co. 005930, +0.65%  retained its lead.As long as iPhone fans keep paying the premium, though, Apple appears set to continue posting big returns. IPhone fans hoping that Apple will drop its price on the top-of-the-line model after last year’s 10th-anniversary edition should probably give up on those hopes.“Expectations vary, from the iPhone 11 starting at $999 (in-line with iPhone X) to a price reduction on the 5.8-inch model to make room for the more expensive iPhone 11 Plus at $999,” Toni Sacconaghi, a Bernstein Research analyst, wrote in a note ahead of Apple’s earnings. “On net, given that screen sizes will be larger on this year’s new offerings than last year’s, and that the new offerings will see incremental feature/functionality, we believe it is more likely that iPhone ASPs will go up than down in fiscal year 2019.”Read also: What could happen to Apple’s ASPs in the next iPhone cycleWhile consumers may not be jazzed about having to shell out $1,000 for an iPhone, investors can breathe easy despite the stalled growth of iPhone unit sales, as other Apple products are also showing strength. The company also talked about big progress in growing its services and software business, and gave the most data yet on the Apple Watch and AirPods, noting that wearables revenue exceeded $10 billion over the past four quarters.But as usual, investor momentum will be focused on the next iPhone launch, at least for the next few months. When it does arrive, expect a $1,000 price tag — or more — on the best one.Apple shares, up about 12.4% so far this year, jumped about 4% in after-hours trading to prices that would be records in regular trading. They have been faring better than the Dow Jones Industrial Average             DJIA, +0.43%          , which counts Apple as a component and is up 2.8% year to date.Want this type of analysis sent to your inbox?

AAPL,07/31/2018 17:59,Apple stock heads for record after earnings and outlook beat,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-earnings-and-outlook-top-expectations-sending-stock-higher-2018-07-31,"In a quarter when iPhone unit sales were of somewhat diminished importance, Apple Inc. beat earnings and revenue expectations and then delivered an upbeat view of what’s to come, sending shares toward record highs.The company reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal third quarter Tuesday, posting earnings per share of $2.34 on revenue of $53.3 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been projecting $2.16 in EPS and $52.3 billion in revenue. Apple stock rose about 4% in after-hours trading, to prices that would be record highs were they to occur during a regular trading session.For more on Apple earnings, see our live blog recapThough Apple AAPL, +0.20%  once again fell short of Wall Street’s estimates for iPhone unit sales, the company more than made up for that thanks to selling more of its premium iPhones. Apple ended up with an iPhone average selling price of $724 in the June quarter, which was far ahead of the $693 analysts were projecting. The spring quarter typically brings the lowest average selling prices of the year as Apple nears the release of new iPhones, but Apple saw a meaningful increase from the $606 it reported in the prior June quarter.Opinion: Apple earnings show why you can expect more $1,000 iPhonesArguably the most useful number in Apple’s fiscal third-quarter report was its September-quarter outlook of $60 billion to $62 billion in revenue, which came in above the FactSet consensus for $59.5 billion in revenue. Typically investors look to Apple’s September forecast for indications of whether the company expects to start selling new iPhones before that quarter ends. Given Apple’s revenue outperformance versus the consensus in the current quarter, though, Apple’s optimism could also be due to product mix.Services revenue has become an increasingly important element of Apple’s business, as it indicates how well the company is able to monetize its installed base of users amid what Chief Executive Tim Cook admitted was a lengthening upgrade cycle. Apple reported $9.5 billion in services revenue for the latest period, up from $7.3 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had been projecting $9.2 billion.See also: Here’s what could happen to Apple’s average selling prices in the next iPhone cycleOn the company’s earnings call, Cook shared more information about the services business, and he was prompted by one analyst to discuss Apple’s various streaming efforts. He talked about how Apple’s services segment was getting a boost from increased usage of third-party subscription-video products within the Apple ecosystem. Apple gets a cut of the subscription fee when consumers sign up for streaming services like Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.74%  , and Cook suggested Apple is seeing growth in video-streaming subscription services at about 100% on a year-over-year basis.As for Apple’s own video content, Cook said there was “no match” for Oprah Winfrey’s ability to connect with audiences — Apple has struck a deal with her. He also said that two Sony veterans brought on last year were working on another exciting but secret project, which could be a rumored streaming service.Don’t miss: Here’s how much Apple could make from streamingApple Music, its streaming-music service, now has upward of 50 million users who either pay for the service or are using a free trial, and Cook said he’s “been told” that the company “took the leadership position in North America” this quarter. He dismissed competitive concerns, saying that the endgame for Apple and rival streaming-music companies such as Spotify Technology SA SPOT, +3.42%  and Pandora Media Inc. P, -2.46%  is to expand the category, not go up against each other.Streaming music is part of Apple’s services segment, which has become an increasingly important element of Apple’s business. The company reported $9.5 billion in services revenue for the latest period, up from $7.3 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had been projecting $9.2 billion.Another closely watched area for Apple is China, where the company has seen a recent rebound. That trend continued in the most recent period, which marked the company’s fourth-straight quarter of double-digit growth in Greater China. Apple generated $9.6 billion in sales from Greater China, up from $8 billion in the prior June quarter.Cook talked a good amount on the call about tariffs, striking a balance between saying that certain trade relationships “are in need of modernizing” but also that tariffs tend to show up “as a tax on the consumer.” As for tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as two other rounds of tariffs that affected $50 billion of Chinese goods, Apple hasn’t seen any of its products directly affected, according to Cook. The company is in the process of “sharing our views with the administration” regarding a fourth round of tariffs that affects goods valued at $200 billion.Read: As the trade war heats up, Goldman says take cover in these stocksOverall, Cook said, he’s “optimistic” that the U.S. and China will be able to work out their trade differences.Apple’s stock has gained 28% over the past 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average             DJIA, +0.43%          , of which Apple is a component, has risen 16%.Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox.

AMZN,08/01/2018 00:23,These 9 stocks will win from the esports craze,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-9-stocks-will-give-you-a-piece-of-the-esports-craze-2018-07-31,"Judging by the amped-up energy inside Brooklyn’s Barclays Center for the premier Overwatch League finals, esports is here to stay — and it’s going to be a big, sustainable consumer trend that should have a place in your investment portfolio.I’m not an esports fan, at least not yet. But I went to last weekend’s finals as an investor to see what all the fuss is about. The atmosphere was electric, especially considering that fans basically watched two teams lined up behind tables on stage, playing games on a big screen above them.London Fusion played Philadelphia Fusion in a sold-out 20,000-seat arena, and London won. It wasn’t quite up there with a Beatles show. No second British Invasion. But it was close. And a lot more electric than most major league sports finals.This enthusiasm is one reason Baird analyst Colin Sebastian thinks interactive entertainment will become the biggest piece of the media and entertainment sector, hitting $145 billion in annual sales by 2020. That makes it a “must own” area for investors, he says.But how? Sebastian highlights content providers Activision Blizzard ATVI, +0.92% Electronic Arts EA, +2.01% and Take-Two Interactive TTWO, -0.08% Here’s a look at these companies and six others that should be good plays on this trend.Videogame publishers benefit directly because they own the esports leagues. This brings in revenue via ticket sales, merchandising, media rights, advertising and sponsorships. They also benefit indirectly because esports will bring in more fans and help boost product sales.Here are the four main companies in esports leagues so far.• Tencent HoldingsTCEHY, -0.65%0700, -0.34%  owns Riot Games, whose League of Legends is one of the world’s most popular games and the basis for the League of Legends Championship Series esports league. Tencent is a key esports holding because it offers exposure to the popularity of esports in China, its home turf. China has the largest gamer base in the world, with about 442 million gamers as of 2017 and a 57% penetration rate of Chinese internet users, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. This year, China will contribute a third of the global game industry’s total revenue, says NewZoo.Tencent has a deal with Disney DIS, +0.83%  (DIS) for streaming and broadcast rights for League of Legends through 2023, and it is launching a competitive-gaming television channel in China.• Activision Blizzard owns the Overwatch League, the league that played that final at the Barclays Center. The league has 12 teams now, but it wants to expand to 28. Activision Blizzard will also create an esports league for its Call of Duty game, says Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher Merwin.Activision Blizzard looks attractive for other reasons. It already has a popular mobile game in Candy Crush. A key source of growth will be the conversion of PC- and console-based titles into mobile games. Mobile is huge in China. So this could give it a greater presence in China, where the company hopes to expand via a partnership with NetEase NTES, -0.62%Another catalyst for the stock should be the release of “Call of Duty Black Ops 4” in October.“We believe Activision is building a Disney-style entertainment business for the 21st century, but with higher operating margins,” says Jefferies analyst Timothy O’Shea.Like the shares of other game publishers, Activision Blizzard stock can suffer bouts of weakness on fears about competition from Fortnite, published by Epic Games. But not to worry. “While undeniably the hottest game we’ve seen in years, Fortnite is more about expanding the market than cannibalizing it,” says O’Shea.Read: Want to make money off the ‘Fortnite’ videogame? Buy this stock• Take-Two Interactive has a partnership with the National Basketball Association to launch the NBA 2K eLeague.• Electronic Arts is developing leagues based on its Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Madden NFL Football games. It doesn’t get much credit for this yet, says Merwin. So it could be the sleeper here.Underscoring the financial muscle behind esports are the big brands that have signed on as sponsors. They include Toyota TM, -2.33%7203, +1.29% HP HPQ, -0.09% Intel INTC, +0.86% T-Mobile US TMUS, +0.30%  , Nissan 7201, +0.81% Berkshire Hathaway’s BRK.A, -0.62%BRK.B, -0.61%  Geico, and Axe, owned by Unilever UN, +0.19%UNIA, +0.41%ULVR, -0.21%Moreover, esport team buyers include traditional sports teams owners or top executives at the New England Patriots, the New York Mets and Comcast Spectator, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers.Read this about videogame earnings: Esports are here to stay, but who is poised to make a killing?Twitch is the most popular platform for watching esports and competitive gaming online. It’s a big deal. Average daily viewership for January was 962,000, which means it did better than two major cable TV according to Mintel. For 2017, average daily viewership was 885,000 for MSNBC and 783,000 for CNN. Celebrities are catching on to the size of the Twitch audience, and making appearances. In March, Drake played Fortnight with the popular gamer Tyler “Ninja” Blevins.Twitch is one of Amazon.com’s AMZN, -0.10% best-kept secrets, says Motely Fool writer John Ballard. He thinks Amazon’s 2014 purchase of Twitch for $970 million is starting to look like a really clever move. Ballard describes Twitch a social network for gamers where viewers can watch their favorite streamers, chat with other gamers and develop their skills.As the biggest platform, with about 70% of monthly active users in the online gaming space according to Goldman Sachs, Twitch benefits from the “network effect.” This means it has the power to continually attract more users, and become more useful to them as it does this. Amazon.com makes money from Twitch by taking a cut of sales on the platform. It has also integrated Twitch into Prime, which helps Prime get more users. “Twitch represents one of the most compelling assets in the world of esports,” says Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry.Oddly, Amazon doesn’t mention Twitch in its most recent 10-Q. It mentions it once in its most recent 10-K, but only as a formality and with no description.Electronic Arts looks like another good platform company to own. Taking a page out of the books of Netflix NFLX, +0.74%  and Spotify SPOT, +3.42% Eletronic Arts is developing a streaming game service.“CEO Andrew Wilson is positioning the company for a future in which videogames are streamed to all devices via subscription,” says Jefferies analyst Timothy O’Shea. The company will offer all its games on the service, and it is working on adding third-party party titles.According to tech investing lore, you do well investing in the companies that make the gear used in a tech trend, and not just the companies selling the final products or services. If that’s true, then Nvidia NVDA, +0.30%  should continue to be a good investment. It makes the high-end GeForce line of graphics processing units (GPUs) used in the high-powered PCs that gamers like. So the growing popularity of esports will help Nvidia.“We view Nvidia as uniquely positioned to capture growth in the PC gaming user base,” says Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari. Nvidia has a dominant position in game-related chips, in part because it puts most of its development budget into its GPU platform while competitor Advanced Micro Device AMD, -5.61%  invests in a number of different product lines. Nvidia’s specialized chips are also used in artificial intelligence, machine-learning data centers and self-driving cars.For arms merchants, also consider Logitech International LOGI, -4.55%  a top supplier of high-end gaming mice, headsets and specialized gaming keyboards. And don’t forget Microsoft MSFT, +0.67% It never did well with smartphones. But consoles are another matter. Microsoft sells the popular Xbox. Late last year it refreshed the line by rolling out the Xbox One X with hardcore gamers in mind.For a broad based approach to the videogame and esports trends, consider the $120 million videogame Tech exchange-traded fund  GAMR, -0.13%  It holds most of the major players in this space, but be warned: it has 72 stocks (the largest is Glu Mobile  GLUU, +2.50%  ), so it is not a pure pay on the names I’ve highlighted above. It also has a steep expense ratio of 0.82%. Not only is that a lot higher than the category average of 0.55%, as calculated by Morningstar, but it’s way more than the 0.09% expense ratio levied for the SPDR S&P 500  SPY, +0.49%  which tracks the S&P 500 index  SPX, +0.49%The ETF is essentially flat on the year, compared with the S&P’s 5% gain.At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.

AMZN,08/01/2018 00:06,Saved by the Smile on the Box: Amazon Canada Launches Back to School and Off to University Stores,http://www.wsj.com/articles/PR-CO-20180801-905657,
AMZN,07/31/2018 10:59,"After a decade of wins, the end may be near for one of Wall Street’s best stock trades",http://www.marketwatch.com/story/after-a-decade-of-wins-the-end-may-be-near-for-one-of-wall-streets-best-stock-trades-2018-07-30,"For years, one of the most successful trades in the U.S. stock market has been to favor high-growth stocks over ones considered to be undervalued. At long last, this trend may be unraveling.Value-based strategies could be poised for a comeback, as the overall economic environment becomes more challenging, with rising interest rates and a less-certain growth outlook. At the same time, the advance in growth-based plays is seen as overdone, as highlighted by recent implosions in some of the strategy’s biggest outperformers, including Facebook and Netflix.“We think the turn is in,” wrote Morgan Stanley in a Monday note to clients, saying that the “almost unprecedented” degree of outperformance by growth over value was poised to shift.Don’t miss: Prepare for the biggest stock-market selloff in months, Morgan Stanley warnsThus far this year, the S&P 500 Growth index SP500G, +0.68%  is up 10.8%, a move that is more than twice the 4.8% gain of the overall S&P 500 SPX, +0.49% Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Value index SP500V, +0.27% is down 0.2% thus far this year.This trend has held across market capitalization sizes. The Russell 1000 Value index RLV, +0.36%  is up 0.4% thus far in 2018, below the overall Russell 1000 RUI, +0.53% (up 4.7%) and the Russell 1000 Growth index RLG, +0.70%  (up 8.8%). The Russell 2000 index RUT, +1.07%  of small-capitalization shares is up 7.7%—the Russell 2000 Growth index RUO, +1.39%  is up 9.7% while its value index RUJ, +0.75%  is up 5.4%.This is hardly new to 2018. Value has been such an underperformer for years—not only relative to growth, but also to the broader market—that last year Goldman Sachs asked whether markets had seen “the death of value.” The investment bank was just one in a chorus of voices sounding the alarm; Jeremy Grantham, the founder of asset manager GMO, suggested that many of the mostly widely used metrics in evaluating undervalued companies no longer held much weight for stock moves.The following FactSet chart looks at the 10-year performance of the S&P 500 growth index (in green), and compares it with both the unadjusted index (red) and the value index (blue). The chart illustrates that growth has consistently, and significantly outperformed over the past decade.“We appreciate the fact that fighting momentum can be a losing game but when things get this extreme and there is evidence of a turn, we have to go the other way,” Morgan Stanley wrote.While growth has done better for years, the degree to which it has been outperforming value has been unusually high of late. According to the investment bank, the difference hasn’t been this extreme since the dot-com era.Furthermore, the valuation difference between the large-cap growth stocks and their value equivalents is also at its most extreme since 2006. According to FactSet, the Russell 1000 growth index has a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.21, compared with the 17.98 ratio of the value index.While growth overall has benefited from an environment with low interest rates and steady economic expansion since the financial crisis, it has particularly benefited as some of the market’s biggest names have been growth plays. In particular, the FAANG group of stocks, which refers to Facebook FB, +0.89% Amazon.com AMZN, -0.10% Apple AAPL, +0.20% Netflix NFLX, +0.74% and Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL, -0.23%GOOG, -0.20% are all high-growth stocks.Related: Why investors shouldn’t sweat the stock market’s reliance on FAANG sharesWhile that group has led the market for years, including in 2018, the rally has recently shown signs of cracks. Both Netflix and Facebook tumbled after their most recent quarterly report, with Facebook suffering its biggest one-day drop ever and dropping into bear-market territory.Facebook’s plummet resulted in a rare week of pronounced outperformance by value instead of growth last week. The S&P 500 value index gained 1.44% over last week, compared with the 0.6% rise of the index overall. The growth index dropped 0.1%. That represented the biggest weekly outperformance by value over growth since December, according to the WSJ Market Data Group.“Whether this is a blip or the start of something new, where investors rotate into value in an earnest way, remains to be seen,” said Michael Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners. “However, the current environment feels a bit like the dot-com era, which was the last time that tech valuations in particular got a little stretched. When those pulled back, that led to a period of value outperformance that lasted for years.”Morgan Stanley espoused this view, saying that the outperformance of growth strategies wasn’t justified by past and forecast earnings growth.“Based on this spread widening over the past year, we think it time for a reversal. Either large-cap value stocks will go up more or large-cap growth stocks will simply come down and catch up with the rest of the market on P/E compression,” it wrote. “We think it will be the latter but would not care if it is the former. Either way Value outperforms Growth and we think the spread can narrow by 10-15% over the next several months.”Morgan Stanley analysts referred to the outperformance by the value contingent last week as “a good start.”Ryan Vlastelica is a markets reporter for MarketWatch and is based in New York.

Facebook FB, +0.89%  executives said they did not investigate whether people actually attended the events nor who was responsible for the inauthentic accounts and activity, citing lack of evidence.“We can assess what happens on Facebook, we can’t assess what happens in the real world, in the external world,” Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday.Don’t miss: Facebook pays for all its mistakes at once, and it is a big billSeveral of the events included mentions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including one that protested ICE.“We would expect these types of actors to engage in popular social movements of this type,” Gleicher said.Lawmakers have confronted Facebook in the past with questions about its role in the Russian-backed Internet Research Agency’s efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. To avoid similar missteps the company has vowed to hire 20,000 people for its safety and security team, as well as stepping up its automated efforts to root out Russian-style influence and introducing additional transparency measures for political ads on its platform, among other efforts. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said that such initiatives will damage the company’s bottom line for the foreseeable future.Facebook security chief Alex Stamos told reporters that the company’s security team made one connection to Russia: an account run by the Russia-backed Internet Research Agency administered one of the fake Facebook pages for about seven minutes.“The connection was a known IRA account … We think that’s interesting but not determinative,” Stamos said, adding that the known IRA account was also removed from Facebook “some time” ago.Read also: Facebook stock drops roughly 20%, loses $120 billion in value after warning that revenue growth will take a hitUnlike Facebook, some lawmakers were quick to lay blame for the fake accounts at Russian’s feet.“Today’s disclosure is further evidence that the Kremlin continues to exploit platforms like Facebook to sow division and spread disinformation, and I am glad that Facebook is taking some steps to pointpoint and address this activity,” said U.S. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.Facebook executives said on the call that the investigation was ongoing, and that the company would provide updates as it progressed — including informing the public who was responsible, should the company be able to make that determination. Whoever is responsible for the inauthentic accounts and posts has done a better job covering their tracks, using several techniques to mask their origins.One of the events linked to the inauthentic accounts was an event in Washington, D.C. on Aug. 10. Facebook said it planned to notify people who had expressed interest in attending. As of Tuesday, 2,600 Facebook members expressed interest in the event and 600 said they would attend.Facebook stock rose 0.9% to $172.57 in afternoon trading. The company’s stock plunged roughly 20% after the company reported earnings last week that missed Wall Street’s expectations; it logged flat user growth in Canada and the U.S., falling growth in Europe and weaker-than-expected revenue projections for the second half of the year.Since Facebook posted earnings last week the S&P 500 index                          SPX, +0.49%                   has gained 0.1%.Max A.

FB,07/31/2018 10:59,"Prepare for the biggest stock-market selloff in months, Morgan Stanley warns",http://www.marketwatch.com/story/prepare-for-the-biggest-stock-market-selloff-in-months-morgan-stanley-warns-2018-07-30,"The U.S. stock market has been partying all throughout July, and a hangover is coming.That is according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, who said that Wall Street’s rally is showing signs of “exhaustion,” and that with major positive catalysts for trading now in the rearview mirror, there’s little that could continue to propel equities higher.“With Amazon’s strong quarter out of the way, and a very strong 2Q GDP number on the tape, investors were finally faced with the proverbial question of ’what do I have to look forward to now?’ The selling started slowly, built steadily, and left the biggest winners of the year down the most. The bottom line for us is that we think the selling has just begun and this correction will be biggest since the one we experienced in February,” the investment bank wrote to clients.The decline “could very well have a greater negative impact on the average portfolio if it’s centered on tech, consumer discretionary and small-caps, as we expect.”Check out: This ‘prophet of doom’ predicts stock market will plunge more than 50%A correction is technically defined as a decline of at least 10% from a recent peak. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.43%  and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.49%  corrected in early February, on concerns that inflation was returning to markets. While the Dow remains in correction territory—meaning it hasn’t yet risen 10% from its low of the pullback—the S&P exited just last week, following its longest stint in correction territory since 1984. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.55%  never fell into correction.Equities have done well of late, with the Dow up 4.3% in July. The S&P 500 has gained 3.1% in the month while the Nasdaq has advanced 1.6%, hitting multiple records along the way, though it has stumbled badly in the past three sessions.Read: After a strong July, August looks ominous for stocksMuch of the rally has come on the second-quarter earnings season, which has both shown strong growth and featured a high number of companies topping analyst expectations. While there were some high-profile disappointments, including from Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.74%  and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.89% —which suffered its biggest one-day drop ever after its results—market participants have generally looked past them.“We must admit, the market sent some misleading signals over the last few weeks by limiting the damage to the broad indices when Netflix and Facebook missed. We believe this simply led to an even greater false sense of security in the market,” wrote the team of Morgan Stanley analysts, led by Michael Wilson, the firm’s chief U.S. equity strategist. Both Facebook and Netflix’s shares fell into bear-market territory on Monday, defined as a drop of at least 20% from a recent peak.Also read: How to predict the next market downturnThe firm forecast “a rolling bear market,” during which “every sector in the S&P 500 has gone through a significant derating” with the exception of tech and consumer discretionary. Those two sectors have contributed the bulk of the market’s advance in 2018; tech has risen 12.5% while the discretionary sector—boosted by Amazon and Netflix, both of which are up more than 50% year-to-date—is up 12.8%.That these two industry groups haven’t fallen much doesn’t mean they won’t, Morgan Stanley warned.“While it is possible tech and consumer discretionary stocks won’t experience the derating witnessed in other cyclical sectors, we think it is unlikely and are only emboldened by the misses from Facebook and Netflix and the price action last week,” they said.“We recognize that money can also move from these sectors to others thereby leaving the S&P 500 around current levels rather than falling 10% as we expect,” they said.Don’t miss: Investors may cheer Q2 earnings, but that isn’t making the outlook for the next quarter any rosierSee also: Why investors shouldn’t sweat the stock market’s reliance on FAANG sharesProviding critical information for the U.S. trading day.

FB,07/31/2018 10:59,"After a decade of wins, the end may be near for one of Wall Street’s best stock trades",http://www.marketwatch.com/story/after-a-decade-of-wins-the-end-may-be-near-for-one-of-wall-streets-best-stock-trades-2018-07-30,"For years, one of the most successful trades in the U.S. stock market has been to favor high-growth stocks over ones considered to be undervalued. At long last, this trend may be unraveling.Value-based strategies could be poised for a comeback, as the overall economic environment becomes more challenging, with rising interest rates and a less-certain growth outlook. At the same time, the advance in growth-based plays is seen as overdone, as highlighted by recent implosions in some of the strategy’s biggest outperformers, including Facebook and Netflix.“We think the turn is in,” wrote Morgan Stanley in a Monday note to clients, saying that the “almost unprecedented” degree of outperformance by growth over value was poised to shift.Don’t miss: Prepare for the biggest stock-market selloff in months, Morgan Stanley warnsThus far this year, the S&P 500 Growth index SP500G, +0.68%  is up 10.8%, a move that is more than twice the 4.8% gain of the overall S&P 500 SPX, +0.49% Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Value index SP500V, +0.27% is down 0.2% thus far this year.This trend has held across market capitalization sizes. The Russell 1000 Value index RLV, +0.36%  is up 0.4% thus far in 2018, below the overall Russell 1000 RUI, +0.53% (up 4.7%) and the Russell 1000 Growth index RLG, +0.70%  (up 8.8%). The Russell 2000 index RUT, +1.07%  of small-capitalization shares is up 7.7%—the Russell 2000 Growth index RUO, +1.39%  is up 9.7% while its value index RUJ, +0.75%  is up 5.4%.This is hardly new to 2018. Value has been such an underperformer for years—not only relative to growth, but also to the broader market—that last year Goldman Sachs asked whether markets had seen “the death of value.” The investment bank was just one in a chorus of voices sounding the alarm; Jeremy Grantham, the founder of asset manager GMO, suggested that many of the mostly widely used metrics in evaluating undervalued companies no longer held much weight for stock moves.The following FactSet chart looks at the 10-year performance of the S&P 500 growth index (in green), and compares it with both the unadjusted index (red) and the value index (blue). The chart illustrates that growth has consistently, and significantly outperformed over the past decade.“We appreciate the fact that fighting momentum can be a losing game but when things get this extreme and there is evidence of a turn, we have to go the other way,” Morgan Stanley wrote.While growth has done better for years, the degree to which it has been outperforming value has been unusually high of late. According to the investment bank, the difference hasn’t been this extreme since the dot-com era.Furthermore, the valuation difference between the large-cap growth stocks and their value equivalents is also at its most extreme since 2006. According to FactSet, the Russell 1000 growth index has a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.21, compared with the 17.98 ratio of the value index.While growth overall has benefited from an environment with low interest rates and steady economic expansion since the financial crisis, it has particularly benefited as some of the market’s biggest names have been growth plays. In particular, the FAANG group of stocks, which refers to Facebook FB, +0.89% Amazon.com AMZN, -0.10% Apple AAPL, +0.20% Netflix NFLX, +0.74% and Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL, -0.23%GOOG, -0.20% are all high-growth stocks.Related: Why investors shouldn’t sweat the stock market’s reliance on FAANG sharesWhile that group has led the market for years, including in 2018, the rally has recently shown signs of cracks. Both Netflix and Facebook tumbled after their most recent quarterly report, with Facebook suffering its biggest one-day drop ever and dropping into bear-market territory.Facebook’s plummet resulted in a rare week of pronounced outperformance by value instead of growth last week. The S&P 500 value index gained 1.44% over last week, compared with the 0.6% rise of the index overall. The growth index dropped 0.1%. That represented the biggest weekly outperformance by value over growth since December, according to the WSJ Market Data Group.“Whether this is a blip or the start of something new, where investors rotate into value in an earnest way, remains to be seen,” said Michael Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners. “However, the current environment feels a bit like the dot-com era, which was the last time that tech valuations in particular got a little stretched. When those pulled back, that led to a period of value outperformance that lasted for years.”Morgan Stanley espoused this view, saying that the outperformance of growth strategies wasn’t justified by past and forecast earnings growth.“Based on this spread widening over the past year, we think it time for a reversal. Either large-cap value stocks will go up more or large-cap growth stocks will simply come down and catch up with the rest of the market on P/E compression,” it wrote. “We think it will be the latter but would not care if it is the former.

MSFT,08/01/2018 00:23,These 9 stocks will win from the esports craze,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-9-stocks-will-give-you-a-piece-of-the-esports-craze-2018-07-31,"Judging by the amped-up energy inside Brooklyn’s Barclays Center for the premier Overwatch League finals, esports is here to stay — and it’s going to be a big, sustainable consumer trend that should have a place in your investment portfolio.I’m not an esports fan, at least not yet. But I went to last weekend’s finals as an investor to see what all the fuss is about. The atmosphere was electric, especially considering that fans basically watched two teams lined up behind tables on stage, playing games on a big screen above them.London Fusion played Philadelphia Fusion in a sold-out 20,000-seat arena, and London won. It wasn’t quite up there with a Beatles show. No second British Invasion. But it was close. And a lot more electric than most major league sports finals.This enthusiasm is one reason Baird analyst Colin Sebastian thinks interactive entertainment will become the biggest piece of the media and entertainment sector, hitting $145 billion in annual sales by 2020. That makes it a “must own” area for investors, he says.But how? Sebastian highlights content providers Activision Blizzard ATVI, +0.92% Electronic Arts EA, +2.01% and Take-Two Interactive TTWO, -0.08% Here’s a look at these companies and six others that should be good plays on this trend.Videogame publishers benefit directly because they own the esports leagues. This brings in revenue via ticket sales, merchandising, media rights, advertising and sponsorships. They also benefit indirectly because esports will bring in more fans and help boost product sales.Here are the four main companies in esports leagues so far.• Tencent HoldingsTCEHY, -0.65%0700, -0.45%  owns Riot Games, whose League of Legends is one of the world’s most popular games and the basis for the League of Legends Championship Series esports league. Tencent is a key esports holding because it offers exposure to the popularity of esports in China, its home turf. China has the largest gamer base in the world, with about 442 million gamers as of 2017 and a 57% penetration rate of Chinese internet users, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. This year, China will contribute a third of the global game industry’s total revenue, says NewZoo.Tencent has a deal with Disney DIS, +0.83%  (DIS) for streaming and broadcast rights for League of Legends through 2023, and it is launching a competitive-gaming television channel in China.• Activision Blizzard owns the Overwatch League, the league that played that final at the Barclays Center. The league has 12 teams now, but it wants to expand to 28. Activision Blizzard will also create an esports league for its Call of Duty game, says Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher Merwin.Activision Blizzard looks attractive for other reasons. It already has a popular mobile game in Candy Crush. A key source of growth will be the conversion of PC- and console-based titles into mobile games. Mobile is huge in China. So this could give it a greater presence in China, where the company hopes to expand via a partnership with NetEase NTES, -0.62%Another catalyst for the stock should be the release of “Call of Duty Black Ops 4” in October.“We believe Activision is building a Disney-style entertainment business for the 21st century, but with higher operating margins,” says Jefferies analyst Timothy O’Shea.Like the shares of other game publishers, Activision Blizzard stock can suffer bouts of weakness on fears about competition from Fortnite, published by Epic Games. But not to worry. “While undeniably the hottest game we’ve seen in years, Fortnite is more about expanding the market than cannibalizing it,” says O’Shea.Read: Want to make money off the ‘Fortnite’ videogame? Buy this stock• Take-Two Interactive has a partnership with the National Basketball Association to launch the NBA 2K eLeague.• Electronic Arts is developing leagues based on its Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Madden NFL Football games. It doesn’t get much credit for this yet, says Merwin. So it could be the sleeper here.Underscoring the financial muscle behind esports are the big brands that have signed on as sponsors. They include Toyota TM, -2.33%7203, +1.29% HP HPQ, -0.09% Intel INTC, +0.86% T-Mobile US TMUS, +0.30%  , Nissan 7201, +0.81% Berkshire Hathaway’s BRK.A, -0.62%BRK.B, -0.61%  Geico, and Axe, owned by Unilever UN, +0.19%UNIA, +0.41%ULVR, -0.15%Moreover, esport team buyers include traditional sports teams owners or top executives at the New England Patriots, the New York Mets and Comcast Spectator, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers.Read this about videogame earnings: Esports are here to stay, but who is poised to make a killing?Twitch is the most popular platform for watching esports and competitive gaming online. It’s a big deal. Average daily viewership for January was 962,000, which means it did better than two major cable TV according to Mintel. For 2017, average daily viewership was 885,000 for MSNBC and 783,000 for CNN. Celebrities are catching on to the size of the Twitch audience, and making appearances. In March, Drake played Fortnight with the popular gamer Tyler “Ninja” Blevins.Twitch is one of Amazon.com’s AMZN, -0.10% best-kept secrets, says Motely Fool writer John Ballard. He thinks Amazon’s 2014 purchase of Twitch for $970 million is starting to look like a really clever move. Ballard describes Twitch a social network for gamers where viewers can watch their favorite streamers, chat with other gamers and develop their skills.As the biggest platform, with about 70% of monthly active users in the online gaming space according to Goldman Sachs, Twitch benefits from the “network effect.” This means it has the power to continually attract more users, and become more useful to them as it does this. Amazon.com makes money from Twitch by taking a cut of sales on the platform. It has also integrated Twitch into Prime, which helps Prime get more users. “Twitch represents one of the most compelling assets in the world of esports,” says Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry.Oddly, Amazon doesn’t mention Twitch in its most recent 10-Q. It mentions it once in its most recent 10-K, but only as a formality and with no description.Electronic Arts looks like another good platform company to own. Taking a page out of the books of Netflix NFLX, +0.74%  and Spotify SPOT, +3.42% Eletronic Arts is developing a streaming game service.“CEO Andrew Wilson is positioning the company for a future in which videogames are streamed to all devices via subscription,” says Jefferies analyst Timothy O’Shea. The company will offer all its games on the service, and it is working on adding third-party party titles.According to tech investing lore, you do well investing in the companies that make the gear used in a tech trend, and not just the companies selling the final products or services. If that’s true, then Nvidia NVDA, +0.30%  should continue to be a good investment. It makes the high-end GeForce line of graphics processing units (GPUs) used in the high-powered PCs that gamers like. So the growing popularity of esports will help Nvidia.“We view Nvidia as uniquely positioned to capture growth in the PC gaming user base,” says Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari. Nvidia has a dominant position in game-related chips, in part because it puts most of its development budget into its GPU platform while competitor Advanced Micro Device AMD, -5.61%  invests in a number of different product lines. Nvidia’s specialized chips are also used in artificial intelligence, machine-learning data centers and self-driving cars.For arms merchants, also consider Logitech International LOGI, -4.55%  a top supplier of high-end gaming mice, headsets and specialized gaming keyboards. And don’t forget Microsoft MSFT, +0.67% It never did well with smartphones. But consoles are another matter. Microsoft sells the popular Xbox. Late last year it refreshed the line by rolling out the Xbox One X with hardcore gamers in mind.For a broad based approach to the videogame and esports trends, consider the $120 million videogame Tech exchange-traded fund  GAMR, -0.13%  It holds most of the major players in this space, but be warned: it has 72 stocks (the largest is Glu Mobile  GLUU, +2.50%  ), so it is not a pure pay on the names I’ve highlighted above. It also has a steep expense ratio of 0.82%. Not only is that a lot higher than the category average of 0.55%, as calculated by Morningstar, but it’s way more than the 0.09% expense ratio levied for the SPDR S&P 500  SPY, +0.49%  which tracks the S&P 500 index  SPX, +0.49%The ETF is essentially flat on the year, compared with the S&P’s 5% gain.At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.

MSFT,07/28/18,"Visa Still Offers Upside, Says Raymond James",https://www.barrons.com/articles/visa-still-offers-upside-says-raymond-james-1532736000,"These reports, excerpted and edited by Barron’s, were issued recently by investment and research firms. The reports are a sampling of analysts’ thinking; they should not be considered the views or recommendations of Barron’s. Some of the reports’ issuers have provided, or hope to provide, investment-banking or other services to the companies being analyzed.Microsoft • MSFT-Nasdaq Outperform • Price $104.40 on July 19 by Evercore ISI Expectations were running high into Microsoft’s fiscal fourth-quarter results, and it delivered another phenomenal quarter highlighted by strong commercial bookings (up 18% in constant-currency gains) and Azure (cloud apps) growth up 85% [all figures in constant currency]. While the commercial cloud business (up 50%, to $6.9 billion, in revenue) continues to garner much of the attention, we believe Microsoft saw strong performance across all of its business lines, with continued acceleration in LinkedIn (up 34%) and gaming (up 38%). Its commercial cloud gross margins continue to tick higher (up 58%), and intelligent cloud operating income jumped 30% year over year.Looking forward, the company continues to see a strong backdrop for its commercial offerings, and we expect another year of double-digit top-line growth and some modest operating leverage (despite a big jump in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018). While one-upping its performance in 2018 will be difficult, the secular trends powering Microsoft’s various businesses remain intact, and we believe it is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for enterprise cloud services. We also view the gaming business as a potential wild card for the stock in 2019. Given that, Microsoft remains one of our top ideas, and we raise our price target to $125 based on the shares trading to 26.3 times enterprise value/2019 free cash flow.Visa • V-NYSE Outperform • Price $140.03 on July 23 by Raymond James We are resuming coverage of Visa with an Outperform rating and $165 target price. Simply put, Visa should continue to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the continued global shift to electronic payments—a game change we believe is still in the middle innings. Additionally, while this powerful cash-to-card secular tailwind certainly isn’t a secret, Visa’s recent move into push payments through its Visa Direct initiative substantially increases the company’s addressable market and could add yet another leg to this powerful growth story. Despite the stock near all-time highs on both a relative and absolute basis, risks to the model are near all-time lows, and we believe there is still plenty of room to run. We recommend that investors add to their positions sooner rather than later.Stryker • SYK-NYSE Buy • Price $172.92 on July 24 by Canaccord Genuity We maintain our Buy on the medical-technologies company following its second-quarter results, which came in ahead of our and the Street’s expectations. Sales of $3.32 billion were up 10.3% Y/Y (up 7.9% organically) and came in slightly ahead of our and the Street’s estimates of $3.32 billion and $3.31 billion, respectively. Strength was once again driven by momentum across the entire portfolio, but especially in its MAKO/Knees, robotic surgical tools, and Neurotech surgical systems.Operationally adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 beat our and consensus estimates of $1.70/$1.73, and an adjusted operating margin of 25.7%, well above our estimate of 25.3%. Stryker’s better-than-expected leverage continues to benefit from its strong top-line sales and cost-savings initiatives.Net-net, second-quarter results reinforce our thesis that Stryker can continue to deliver on mid-single-digit organic revenue growth as it continues to take market share across the board and begin benefiting from a meaningful “halo” effect from its assorted MAKO placements—something we expect to continue and then accelerate in 2018. Further, we note underlying new-product cycles in medical surgery and orthopedics/reconstruction further supporting fundamental momentum across Stryker’s other offerings—which we feel is lost on most of MAKO-focused investors. The shares are pricey at 21.9 times 2019 estimated EPS, but we expect best-in-class execution and new-product cycles. Target price: $185.JetBlue Airways • JBLU-Nasdaq Outperform • Price $17.79 on July 24 by Imperial Capital JetBlue generated revenue of $7.3 billion, $1.4 billion of Ebitdar—earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs—and EPS of $1.54 in the 12 months ended on June 30. As of June 30, it had $907 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2 billion of long-term debt.We maintain our Outperform but lower our one-year price target to $24 from $26. We also cut our third-quarter 2018 EPS estimate to 48 cents from 53 cents, fiscal-2018 EPS estimate to $1.40 from $1.50, and our fiscal-2019 estimate to $1.75 from $1.85. Our fiscal-2018 estimate assumes capacity increases at 6.5% (unchanged); revenue per available seat mile, or RASM, increases of 2.25% versus 2.75% previously; and costs per available seat mile ex-fuel increases of 1.75% versus 2% previously. Our fiscal-2019 EPS estimate now assumes a RASM increase of 2%, versus 2.5% previously.To be considered for this section, material should be sent to Research@barrons.com."
MSFT,07/27/18,Caution Hits Options Markets as Liquidity Fears Flare,https://www.barrons.com/articles/caution-hits-options-markets-as-liquidity-fears-flare-1532628832,"Even as major U.S. stock indexes crept higher this past week—at least until Facebook’s earnings-related plunge jolted the Nasdaq Composite—the options market was signaling caution.An upbeat earnings season, with the majority of companies beating estimates so far, has encouraged U.S. equity investors. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% this past week and snapped out of correction territory. It is now very close to its January peak, despite heightened volatility.Options trading reveals a different picture. Skew, which measures the cost of protection against stock declines, hit a record on Wednesday on the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (ticker: QQQ) as the Nasdaq breached a fresh high, according to Credit Suisse. The exchange-traded fund holds stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).That’s a sign investors are seeking stock protection, shunning bullish call options that would pay out with another jump in equity prices. And they’re trying to shield their biggest winners from losses.Skew remains at high levels for the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), which tracks smaller companies. Both ETFs have rallied this year as investors bet on tech and the belief that smaller companies would be isolated from a trade war.As stocks capped off their third straight week of gains on July 20, the measure inched higher for the S&P 500 as well, though it subsided this past week. “The possibility of a severe trade war driving the [S&P 500] as low as 2200 by year-end adds urgency to hedging,” wrote Goldman Sachs equity derivatives strategist Rocky Fishman in a July 23 note, referring to a greater than a 20% fall.The threat of a trade war between the U.S. and the European Union appeared to recede on Wednesday, but tariff frictions with other countries remain a risk.Though a measure of expected stock swings via the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, slumped during the week, volatility has trickled through commodities, with sharp moves in oil becoming commonplace.Investors looking to take the options market’s lead could sell call options on the S&P 500 to purchase hedges, Fishman says. Calls confer the right to buy shares at a given time. Put options give the right to sell stock.There’s another reason he recommends protection now. Analysts have been sounding the alarm about liquidity, an often-arcane subject that has wide-ranging implications for investors large and small. Goldman has analyzed data that suggests it could get prohibitively expensive to trade when markets come under stress, as liquidity in derivatives has thinned since January.Signs of this have mounted in recent years, but the first-quarter stock rout exposed how problematic it can be. The difference between buy and sell prices across options contracts has jumped since 2012, a sign of falling market health, The Wall Street Journal reported last year. Even widely traded products like S&P 500 futures and VIX derivatives seem to be affected now.“Low liquidity means high vulnerability to shocks,” Fishman says. The top-of-book depth, which measures how many contracts are available to trade in an instant without moving markets significantly, has sunk for S&P 500 futures, he says.That was on display earlier this year. The options market fared worse in February than during the August 2015 selloff, when China’s devaluation of the yuan roiled markets, according to the Journal.As investors fled popular exchange-traded products tracking the VIX, liquidity in the VIX futures and options market depleted and the number of traders participating shrank, according to Maneesh Deshpande, head of global equity derivatives strategy at Barclays. A bright spot has been options on the S&P 500, he says.These dynamics could improve if volatility recedes, Deshpande says. For now, it’s a harbinger of difficult trading dynamics when markets tumble.Gunjan Banerji covers options for The Wall Street Journal.Write to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com"
MSFT,07/27/18,"GM, First Republic, and More Stock Picks for the Patient",https://www.barrons.com/articles/gm-first-republic-and-more-stock-picks-for-the-patient-1532706847,"Sarat Sethi and Ned Dewees, the two managing partners at Douglas C. Lane & Associates, consider themselves old-fashioned, buy-and-hold stockpickers. Between them, they have 42 years at the firm, which oversees $5.4 billion for its clients. Sethi, 48, and Dewees, 61, don’t fit neatly into one particular investing style; they invest in long-term themes that can lead them almost anywhere in the market. Today, their big themes include a rosy view of the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer, and Big Data. The firm runs separate accounts, usually with about 60 stocks. Their stock portfolios, which typically don’t include Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN) or Netflix (NFLX), haven’t fared well lately. The firm’s core equity composite had a net return of 0.27% for the first half, trailing the S&P 500 by more than two percentage points. The news is better over the long run. Since its inception in June 1995, the equity composite has an annual return of 10.2%, versus 9.3% for the S&P 500. Barron’s sat down with Sethi and Dewees at their midtown Manhattan office to learn the reasons for their optimism, and what that means for the stocks in their portfolio.Barron’s: You manage a concentrated, go-anywhere portfolio. Where do you start?Sethi: We look for the best valuations—large-cap, small-cap, value, or growth, it doesn’t matter to us. Our tendency is to look for stocks that are out of favor, but that doesn’t hold us back from buying growth stocks, as well. We may think a stock is undervalued based on its core intrinsic value or its growth rate, even a high growth rate. Stocks don’t have to have a certain metric for us to buy them.Dewees: Our largest holding is Illumina [ILMN], a biotech firm. It used to be a mid-cap stock, but now it is a large-cap with a high multiple, trading at more than 60 times this year’s earnings estimate. Also in the top 10 is General Motors [GM], which is trading at six times earnings, with a yield of nearly 4%. We also have two smaller-cap stocks in our top 10 : IAC/InterActiveCorp [IAC] and XPO Logistics [XPO], both with market caps of about $12 billion.Amazon and Netflix are conspicuously absent from your portfolio, which hasn’t helped you relative to the market.Sethi: They are great companies, but at these levels, there are better opportunities elsewhere.What do you like about the tech stocks you do own?Sethi: We’ve owned Alphabet [GOOGL] for five years; it owns mobile search globally, and YouTube is also a growth engine. Facebook [FB] is still the best platform for targeted advertising, and it has massive growth rates. That hasn’t changed [after last Thursday’s 19% drop]. We also own Microsoft [MSFT]; its Office 365’s subscription growth combined with Azure, its cloud computing service, is a powerful combination. We also own some value plays in tech, like Oracle [ORCL], which we view as a turnaround as it shifts more of its business to a subscription model.You mentioned General Motors as a top holding—it has been cheap for a long time. What’s to like?Sethi: It seems like anytime somebody in the world sneezes, GM catches a cold. But they have bought back more than 20% of their shares since 2011. It is a free-cash-flow machine. Its yield is nearly 4%, and it trades at six times this year’s earnings estimate. I’m not sure what its growth is, but GM has a much better growth rate than six times earnings.Dewees: People still don’t believe that GM will go through the next downturn in the auto cycle and not go down to making zero or $1 a share. Our strong belief is it will be able to get through a downturn. If there’s a frustration with holding this stock, it’s that we’ve just gone through this good period for auto sales in the past five years—but the stock hasn’t done well in that time. Its annual return is 5%, versus 13% for the S&P 500.GM released disappointing earnings this week in which it lowered earnings guidance for this year. Does that change your view of the stock?Sethi: No. This company is as cheap, if not cheaper, than it has ever been since its initial public offering in 2010, yet it’s a far stronger business. It’s increasingly clear to us that GM needs to demonstrate its resilience in a downturn for the company to shrug off the historical biases embedded in the company’s valuation.That could take a while.Dewees: We’re patient investors.Sethi: I’m going to clip a 4% coupon of a stock that’s trading at six times earnings. GM has done its heavy lifting within its core automotive business by derisking its operations and eliminating bad businesses.How high can GM’s stock go?Dewees: Price targets are always tricky because if you invest in a good company that is going to innovate and grow, why would you say, “I’m investing in it at $30 and I’ll sell it at $45,” if the company is going to continue to run well? Right now, there’s the wall of worry, even as the market remains healthy and strong. True, there are geopolitical factors, including tariff fears—although we are talking about a tiny piece of tariffs. But the stock market will continue to think that a shoe is about to drop, although the underlying health of this economy is better than it has been for a long, long time.How so?Sethi: We think the economy remains healthy, with wages rising, healthy employment, and strong demand. Additionally, corporate and consumer confidence is strong. However, a drawn out trade/tariff war or suddenly high interest rates could be a potential headwind to the economy and investor confidence.Your portfolio has a bigger helping of financial and industrial stocks than the S&P 500. What’s so appealing? Let’s start with financials.Sethi: The valuations are cheaper than the S&P, and the growth rate is higher. One of our holdings is First Republic Bank [FRC], a regional bank in San Francisco with a market cap of $16 billion. They do traditional lending and wealth management. Their management team has a solid track record; they have very focused strategies in the markets that they want to be in, including the West Coast, Massachusetts, Florida, Connecticut, and New York.This bank is underappreciated for its high-single-digit growth rate, although the stock does trade at a premium to the S&P 500. It’s at about 21 times this year’s earnings estimate of $4.77 a share and a little more than two times book value, which is reasonable.For many banks, loan growth has been a concern. Is that the case with First Republic?Sethi: That’s another misperception of the market. One thing to consider is that the tax cuts have helped companies and their cash flow. And these banks are not necessarily going out to get more loans. Secondly, interest rates are still relatively low, so a lot of individuals and corporations have termed out their debt, meaning they are taking out debt over longer periods. They don’t necessarily have to borrow money in the short term when they can get loans over three, five, 10 years—and further—out.And presumably there’s an impact from interest rates still being quite low.Sethi: That’s right. Rates are still relatively low going out on the yield curve. It’s at the front end of the curve where rates have moved a lot higher. Why get higher rates at the front end when you can actually go out over longer time periods and issue bonds at very reasonable rates? A lot of companies have done that. However, that reduces a bank’s lending activity. Plus, a lot of banks, including First Republic, are being more stringent in their lending.OK. And as for industrials? What do you like there?Dewees: Maxar Technologies [MAXR]. The company took that name last year when DigitalGlobe was acquired by a Canadian satellite company called MacDonald, Dettwiler & Associates. It was run by Howard Lance since May 2016. One of the first things he did was buy DigitalGlobe, whose stock we owned at the time. So we became an owner of the combined company, which changed its name to Maxar. It used to only trade in Toronto. But it now trades on the New York Stock Exchange, as well. Howard Lance ran Harris Corp. [HRS], a defense electronics company, from 2003 to 2011, and he did a great job. He’s very experienced and capable, and, in his early 60s, we expect him to accomplish a lot more. He is one of the main reasons we own Maxar. The valuation is pretty low: about 11 times this year’s consensus earnings estimate of $4.76 a share with a 2% dividend yield.What’s the market concerned about?Dewees: People are worried about the strength of the legacy satellite-construction business of MacDonald, Dettwiler, and they are worried about a big U.S. government contract with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency that is coming up for renewal in 2020. That’s the old DigitalGlobe business.It’s our feeling that the NGA is going to renew that contract, which represents 15% of revenues today. The satellite constellation used to support the NGA contract isn’t exclusively for U.S. defense purposes; it is also used by U.S.-friendly foreign governments, plus there are commercial uses like figuring out where farmers should plant their crops. Maxar also has a library of satellite images that can be used for all kinds of data analytics. The company has a cloud-based, open-source platform that hosts the imagery and allows app developers and other third parties to access the image library to build new apps and algorithms. It’s an asset-light business that’s small but growing fast. It’s very valuable.What about the satellite-construction business?Dewees: It has been lumpy. They’ll have a big year, followed by one that’s not as strong. Remember, though, that the large satellite-construction business represents less than 10% of the company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Maxar recently reported earnings that came in below the consensus; they had a soft quarter. Investors have extrapolated that to Maxar’s long term-growth rate. We think it was more of a blip. Another concern is that it will take a few years to pay down debt they took on for the DigitalGlobe deal, but it’s manageable. Our view is that the stock is worth $100 a share, compared with $52 and change recently.Thanks, Ned and Sarat. •"
